 <title>John Hamerton, paper miller of Newnham, Hampshire, 1743</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/john-hamerton-paper-miller-newnham-hampshire-1743</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamerton was a paper miller at Hook Mill in Newnham.  He was a co-partner in the business with Robert Parker who was bankrupt at the time of Hamerton’s death and claimed half of the value of the tools of trade.  The inventory and accounts attached list detailed equipment used in the mill as well as high value items in the house such as gold and diamond rings, looking glasses and silver plate.  Hamerton’s widow submitted accounts following her husband’s decease disputing ownership of rags sent from London by Parker and listing debts received from customers living in Basingstoke, Newbury, Winchester and Reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full transcription of his will, inventory and his widow&#039;s accounts are below together with a description of paper making and explanation of some of the goods listed in his inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Newnham census 1851-1901</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/newnham-census-1851-1901</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newnham was a sizeable village situated on the London clay just north of the Hampshire chalk downs. In this period it was mainly agricultural. The railway had a major impact on the parish especially when the track was doubled in the 1890s.  The population of the parish increased significantly at the end of the 19th century as the economy diversified to include many railway workers and those working at the brickworks. The hamlet of Hook was within Newnham until 1932.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Newnham Probate Material 1661-80</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/newnham-probate-material-1661-80</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are five surviving inventories and three wills for this period. The testators were farmers with one innkeeper. Thomas Riggs (d. 1665) was a minor whose parents appear to have predeceased him and his guardian had sold the family farm. The little information surviving in these inventories still reveals a cattle and crops economy with no sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text.

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period comprises the Civil Wars and Interregnum. Two wills and inventories survive in Hampshire record office for 1641 the year before the First Civil War (1642-6) broke out. Three wills survive for the civil war periods in the National Archives and four for the Interregnum (1649-60). The wills in the National Archives were proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury which took over from the local ecclesiastical courts when bishops were abolished in 1646.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two wills and three inventories survive for this period. They indicate that Newnham had a mixed farming economy with cattle and crops.

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is only one surviving will with inventory for this period. The relationship, if any, between Denes, who died in 1572 and Robert Lyde (d. 1541) is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transcription has been made from a copy of the original probate document supplied by HRO.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written.
