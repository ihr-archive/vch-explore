 <title>Sir James Thynne&#039;s Almshouses</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/sir-james-thynnes-almshouses</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lying between the river Wylye and the Warminster to Shaftesbury road (A350), Sir James Thynneâ€™s almshouses are a two-storey stone building with stone slate roof. They were founded in 1655 by a bequest of Sir James Thynne of Longleat, who left money for the support of six poor men and two poor women, along with money to buy each of them a new cloak each year. On the gable end facing the road is a wooden clock face and a louvred bellcote, both added in the 19th century. They continue to serve their original purpose, providing accomodation for six elderly people, and were most recently refurbished in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
