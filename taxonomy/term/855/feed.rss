 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;label-inline&quot;&gt;Copyright:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;Hampshire Wills Group&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spencer&lt;/strong&gt; was still working as a clothier although the trade had generally declined in Basingstoke at this time. He left 12&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;. apiece to all his workers for them to buy gloves. He also left 20&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;. to be distributed in bread to the poor of Basingstoke. He owned a house in Basingstoke and another in Reading which he left to his two sons and daughter on condition that they paid their mother £6 per annum. Other bequests were made to his nephews, grandchildren and other family members.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Will and Inventory of Robert Lancaster, glover 1699</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/assets/will-and-inventory-robert-lancaster-glover-1699</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;label-inline&quot;&gt;Copyright:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;Hampshire Wills Group&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lancaster&lt;/strong&gt; was a glover, possibly never married and elderly as he left bequests of £25 to each of three cousins and his sister and the remainder of his assets to two brothers. Although his monetary bequests amounted to £100 his inventory only totalled £24 1&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;. He had a kitchen well stocked with implements and a looking glass, a sign of status. His inventory did not reflect his trade other than to call one room his ‘working chamber’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Will of Joseph Mooreing, gentleman 1698</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/assets/will-joseph-mooreing-gentleman-1698</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;label-inline&quot;&gt;Copyright:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;Hampshire Wills Group&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mooreing&lt;/strong&gt; was a gentleman with property in Basingstoke, Basing, Rotherwick, Hook and fields in Andover which he left to his nephews. He initially left his malt house in Basingstoke to nephew Christopher, but in a codicil he stated that he didn’t know if Christopher was dead or alive as he was in the ‘Island of Virginia’ so re-distributed the properties between the other nephews. Also, he initially left his maid servant £50 but as she had married and left his service he reduced this to £5. No inventory survives.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;label-inline&quot;&gt;Copyright:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;Hampshire Wills Group&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acton&lt;/strong&gt; was a clerk and probably the brother of Edward, gentleman (d. 1686). He left valuable bequests of rings, silver and gold items to family members, his old nurse, servants and friends. He also willed the patronage of Collingbourne Ducis in Wiltshire to his brother Edward. He pledged five guineas to New College, Oxford to buy divinity books and specified a book entitled Sandy’s Travels to be given to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;label-inline&quot;&gt;Copyright:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;Hampshire Wills Group&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windover&lt;/strong&gt; died intestate and his father renounced his duty to administer the goods, passing responsibility to Joseph’s brother. Windever was a collar maker, i.e. he made harnesses and collars for horses. His inventory included details of tools, hides, and finished articles ready for sale. He also owned a shop in Odiham. His total inventory amounted to £402 10&lt;em&gt;s.&lt;/em&gt; 2&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;., but £285 12&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;. of this was due in debts, bonds and securities.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;label-inline&quot;&gt;Copyright:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;Hampshire Wills Group&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box &lt;/strong&gt;described himself as an innkeeper but there is no hint of this in his will and no inventory survives. He left £25 to one son and £100 to each of five other children. He was probably a young man as he left provision for bequests to any future children that may be born to him and his wife after the signing of his will. He owned property in Basingstoke and Sherborne St John.&lt;/p&gt;
