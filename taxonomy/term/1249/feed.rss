 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishops Hull acquired several new residents from the mid 18th century who had formerly lived in the West Indies. The Mills of Milligan Hall were plantation and slave owners from Nevis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Mary Sweet and her Hotel</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/mary-sweet-and-her-hotel</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Sweet was the creator of the western side of the present Castle Hotel, Taunton in the 1830s. She gave Taunton probably its first luxury hotel. She was one of many female hoteliers in Somerset in the mid 19th century creating high-class family hotels often out of traditional inns or as  in Mary’s case creating a new business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Bishops Hull War Memorial</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/bishops-hull-war-memorial</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The war memorial for Bishops Hull stands in a prominent position in the centre of the village. There are plaques around the plinth replacing the originals. In 2017 it was planned to replace that for the First World War, which contains errors and omissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war memorial is naturally a focal point for remembering those in the community who died in conflict but of course men from Bishops Hull had served and died in the military services long before there was any thought of war memorials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Roughmoor mill</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/roughmoor-mill</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other Bishops Hull mills Roughmoor mill was not on the river Tone but on one of its northern tributaries. Like many mills in the area it had many uses over its history from cloth production to flour milling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Fideoak and Longaller Mills</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Fideoak mill and Longaller mill in Bishops Hull were on Fideoak manor and were fulling mills in 1578 and presumably until the 17th century. The main buildings of the latter survive with the leat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Bishops Hull Mills</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/bishops-hull-mills</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medieval manor mill at Bishops Hull went out of use in the 1340s but by the late 16th century the parish was home to a large number of mills, all but one on the river Tone. Frethey mill was in use from the mid 16th to early 18th centuries and Burchin mill, a former fulling mill, was a grain mill by 1585 but was ruinous by the 1780s.  Like all rural mills near Taunton they suffered competition from the development of the medieval manor mills near the Castle into the Town Mills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Longrun and Whipples Mill</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/longrun-and-whipples-mill</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longrun with its former farmstead is well known to dog walkers, runners, young people and others but the millpond is hidden and nearly dry and all trace of the mill has disappeared. The former medieval fields and meadows now form part of a large public open space between Taunton and Bishops Hull village in the floodplain of the river Tone known for its willow cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>A Victorian Home at Roughmoor, Bishops Hull</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/victorian-home-roughmoor-bishops-hull</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somerset has a good selection of 17th and 18th century probate inventories for the west of the county but later ones are rare. The Victorian inventory gives a glimpse into the life of a middle class family following the death of its father George Rogers in 1873.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Burials in Bishops Hull during the Civil War</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/burials-bishops-hull-during-civil-war</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Civil War Taunton because of its castle was frequently the scene of military activity. The castle actually lay in Bishops Hull parish, which is probably why several soldiers were taken there for burial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
