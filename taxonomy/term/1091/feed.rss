 <title>Marshwood, Carhampton</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/marshwood-carhampton</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshwood in Carhampton parish was wood pasture in 1279 but was partly cleared for a deer park between 1330 and 1355. By the mid 15th century part of the park and the area around were in agricultural use. By the mid 17th century the 15th-century park lodge had become a substantial residence, a dairy had been established and the park had become merely an adjunct to a large farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deer were gradually replaced by cattle and horses during the early 18th century and by 1840 the park was all in fields and Marshwood Farm was one of the largest and most valuable farms in the parish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Nonconformity in Carhampton and Withycombe</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/nonconformity-carhampton-and-withycombe</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two rural parishes have little evidence of protestant dissent before the 19th century and Wesleyan Methodism was slow to establish but in the hill areas at Rodhuish and Withycombe the Bible Christians attracted a following.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
