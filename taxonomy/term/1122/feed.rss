 <title>Minehead district turnpike roads</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/minehead-district-turnpike-roads</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1765 a route from Minehead harbour to Bampton via Friday Street and Dunster was turnpiked, with the road to Carhampton, by the Minehead Trust, which ceased in 1877. The establishment of the turnpike coincided with the decline in trade and the tolls failed to cover costs. The turnpike debt was nearly £13,000 by 1836 but the roads remained narrow and poorly surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West of Minehead the roads were never turnpiked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>River Avill</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/river-avill</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river Avill, famous for the snowdrop valley near its source, is small but significant. It is crossed by many ancient bridges and formerly powered several mills before discharging itself into the Bristol Channel at the former Dunster Haven. North of Dunster it is largely man made but to the south its beautiful valley is lined with woods and pastures and provides a route for the only significant north-south road in Exmoor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
