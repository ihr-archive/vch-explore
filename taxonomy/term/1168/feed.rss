 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kilby is aboutÂ 8 miles south-east of Leicester, and on the Grand Union Canal. Like many south-Leicestershire villages, in the early 19th century, many of the inhabitants were framework knitters. The village is closely linked with that of Wistow through common land ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 7 miles south of Leicester, Kilby is a rural village of approximately 100 households and is unusual in having four farmyards opening directly on to the main street. The church, which post-dates the gravestones in the churchyard, stands down a small lane away from the main part of the village.&lt;/p&gt;
