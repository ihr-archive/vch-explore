 <title>Old Basing Probate Material 1601 to 1620</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-probate-material-1601-1620</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probate records for 29 Old Basing residents survive for this period comprising 18 wills, 23 inventories, one court paper and two sets of accounts. Several of the documents indicate considerable wealth with land owned in neighbouring parishes and gentlemen of high status, some owning weapons. Farming is dominant as would be expected on the chalk which dominates in the south of the parish. Much of the north of the parish lies on clay soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fuller&#039;s inventory of 1602 reflected the continuing importance of the local cloth industry. Other inventories contained spinning and weaving equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John White (d.1608) was very interesting as he was a gentleman and member of the Marquis of Winchester&#039;s staff with interests across southern England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents have been transcribed by the wills group of the Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke working from copies of original probate documents supplied by The National Archives and Hampshire Record Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Old Basing (Basing) Probate Material 1581-1600</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-basing-probate-material-1581-1600</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this period 21 wills, 26 inventories and one court paper survive. Mostly, these are held in Hampshire Record Office but with one in the National Archives. They show the local mixed farming community with cattle, sheep and crops. Some of the farms were on the clay soil in the north of the parish and others on the chalk in the south. One prominent faming family were the Mulfords for six of whom probate documents survive. Associated rural trades are also recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Old Basing is described as Basing being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ibstock Probate Material, 1640 and earlier</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/ibstock-probate-material-1640-and-earlier</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibstock is one of Leicestershire&#039;s largest villages. It is in the west Leicestershire coalfield area, and both coal mining and clay extraction for brick-making have shaped its size and character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other mining villages in this area, nonconformity was strong. The village had one of the very few British schools in the county (affiliated to the non-denominational British and Foreign Schools Society), in contrast to most Leicestershire villages, where the school was closely tied to the Anglican church. Plans of the British School show that it had the sloping floor beloved by educationalist Joseph Lancaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probate inventories reveal a diverse community lived here in the late 16th, 17th and early 18th centuries. Some people had substantial wealth, often in money and bonds (loans to others) rather than farming assets. The quantity and range of goods in Samuel Goadby&#039;s shop (1705) are similar to those found in the shops of market towns.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Tendring Level (Holland Haven)</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/tendring-level-holland-haven</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsibility for sea defence and drainage in coastal regions since the early thirteenth century had been allocated to &lt;em&gt;ad hoc &lt;/em&gt;Commissions of walls and ditches (&lt;em&gt;de walliis et fossatiis&lt;/em&gt;) appointed by the Crown. The commissioners were officers who had powers to enforce local communal responsibilities for the maintenance of sea walls, banks and drains, and thus attempt to prevent flooding and the inroads of the sea. They could make local by-laws and raise rates to ensure the essential work was undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such commissioners for Tendring Hundred (equivalent to the modern Tendring district) were first recorded about 1450, when the abbot of St Osyth, John Godmanston, esq., John Green and Robert Tanfield and others were appointed. The powers of such royal Commissions was consolidated by Statute in 1531 in A General Act concerning Commissions of Sewers. This was enacted &#039;considering daily great damages and losses which have happened in many and diverse parts ... by reason of the outrageous flowing surges and course of the sea in and upon marsh grounds and other low places&#039;. Under the 1531 At the Commissions initially only lasted three years, but another Commissions of Sewers Act of 1571 later extended the term to ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the Tendring commissioners met infrequently for information about the 15th and 16th centuries is scant, and the extent of the sea defences around the Gunfleet estuary and on the coastline of Great Holland, Little Holland and Frinton remains unknown. A reference to &#039;le level de Gunfletehaven&#039; in 1542 may indicate that some drainage activity had taken place, for the word &#039;level&#039; was often used of partly reclaimed marshlands of the type protected by the activities of commissioners. Other examples of the use of the word are the Somerset Levels and the Gwent Levels of south-east Wales. A document concerning poaching at Little Holland in 1609 referred to &#039;a drowned land called the Flatts&#039;, and the same term was used as an alternative for the Tendring Level in 1703.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem that the gradual silting up of the Gunfleet estuary and the Holland Brook or River that fed it necessitated a response from the commissioners, probabaly stimulated by those whose livelihood was being affected by the flooding and perhaps the loss of trading opportunities. The response was a plan to make a sea wall across the estuary between Little Holland and Frinton, and thus reclaim by drainage the former estuary. It is not known precisely when the sea wall was first constructed, but it appears to have been sometime in the 17th century. A survey of the Tendring Level after the Great Storm of 1703 mentioned a &#039;breach&#039; that had been made, suggesting that the sea wall existed by that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sluice was included in the new wall which could be opned at low tide to allow the river watre to escape, the sluice gate then being closed to prevent th rising tide from entering and flooding the newly won marshes. The original sluice was at Sandy Point near Frinton which seems to have been the natural outfall of the river water from the Holland Brook, although it was later moved east to the site of the present sluice at Holland Haven. As a result many hundreds of acres of land were reclaimed in the parishes of Great Holland, Little Holland, Frinton, Great Clacton, Little Clacton and Thorpe-le-Soken.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Loddington Probate Inventories</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/loddington-probate-inventories</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;Loddington is a very small rural settlement and civil parish in east Leicestershire with a population of less than 100.  The settlement lies in a protected hollow, and to the south of the settlement the land slopes down to the Eye Brook, which forms the southern boundary of the parish. The eastern boundary is also the county boundary with Rutland. 


John Nichols (1800) described Loddington as &#039;one of the finest lordships of old enclosure&#039; in the county. W.G. Hoskins saw the area as ‘lovely withdrawn country’, which is ‘more like Devon than Leicestershire’.


Loddington does not have a Parish Council as such but forms a Parish Meeting with Launde civil parish to the north.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Newnham Probate Material 1661-80</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/newnham-probate-material-1661-80</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are five surviving inventories and three wills for this period. The testators were farmers with one innkeeper. Thomas Riggs (d. 1665) was a minor whose parents appear to have predeceased him and his guardian had sold the family farm. The little information surviving in these inventories still reveals a cattle and crops economy with no sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Basingstoke is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/newnham-probate-material-1641-60</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period comprises the Civil Wars and Interregnum. Two wills and inventories survive in Hampshire record office for 1641 the year before the First Civil War (1642-6) broke out. Three wills survive for the civil war periods in the National Archives and four for the Interregnum (1649-60). The wills in the National Archives were proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury which took over from the local ecclesiastical courts when bishops were abolished in 1646.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written.

 <title>Sewstern Probate Material</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/sewstern-probate-material</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sewstern is the easternmost village in Leicestershire, and lies 10 miles north-east of Melton Mowbray, close to the borders of Lincolnshire and Rutland. It was part of the ancient parish of Buckminster, and is now united with Buckminster again after a period as a separate civil parish between 1866 and 1936. The land was enclosed, along with that of Buckminster, in 1597. The present church of Holy Trinity was built in 1842, and the tithe map of that date shows no building on that site, but a record of 1220 refers to a chapel here where services &#039;ought to&#039; have been taken three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probate records are gradually being transcribed for Sewstern, and will be added to this page as work progresses. There are 44 surviving probate inventories covering the period 1633-1716, with an average (mean) vaue of £119 3s. and a median of £45 10s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memorial pictured has been placed inside Buckminster church, but what is the date? Stylistically, the stone is late 17th century. Could it be in memory of the Katherine Bury whose probate inventory (of 1691) is included on this site? Did the mason get the 6 and the 9 round the wrong way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate page has been created for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/buckminster-probate-material&quot;&gt;probate material relating to Buckminster &lt;/a&gt;itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Buckminster Probate Material</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/buckminster-probate-material</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckminster stands on high ground in east Leicestershire, 10 miles north-east of Melton Mowbray and close to the county borders with Lincolnshire and Rutland. As the place-name suggests, there was a Saxon minster here, although the present church of St John the Baptist does not appear to contain any work before the 13th century. Around three-quarters of the land is pasture and was enclosed in 1597. In 1842 the Earl of Dysart owned 1,359 acres of the 1,796 acres in the township. Apart from a brief period between 1866 and 1936 the parish also included the township of Sewstern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probate records are gradually being transcribed for Buckminster, and will be added to this page as work progresses. There are 29 surviving probate inventories covering the period 1634-1811, with an average (mean) value of £88 13s. and a median of £39 10s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate page has been created for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/sewstern-probate-material&quot;&gt;Sewstern probate material&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cheltenham medieval wills</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/cheltenham-medieval-wills</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very few medieval wills are known for Cheltenham. Four survive in the PROB11 series at the National Archives, and will be added here as transcription proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 6 copy wills survive at Worcestershire RO. They have been trancribed from microfilm, with the loss of occasional words towards the edge of the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pious bequests are a marked feature of these pre-Reformation wills, and give clues as the contemporary arrangement of the parish church in Cheltenham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
