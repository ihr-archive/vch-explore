 <title>Andwell census 1851-1901</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/andwell-census-1851-1901</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small, extra-parochial district of Andwell, located on the north-eastern edge of the Hampshire Downs approximately 22 miles (35 kilometres) to the north-east of Winchester and 4 miles (6.5 kilometres) to the east of Basingstoke, was bounded on the south and west by the manor of Mapledurwell, on the east by the parish of Up Nately and on the north by the parish of Nately Scures. Andwell and Up Nately are discussed together in VCH histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founding of a monastery in the 12th century on hitherto waste land at Andwell created an area that remained outside the existing parochial structure, and these parts of Andwell manor (but not those in the traditional open field area) remained extra parochial, and became a civil parish in 1858. Andwell manor was owned by Winchester College. In 1880, Up Nately, with the detached lands still within it, became a civil parish of 1,149 a.(464 ha.) while Andwell, was left as a civil parish of only 148 a.(60 ha.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven wills and four inventories survive for this period, including the wills of three wealthy testators from Andwell. The Withers (Joane and Thomas) were a gentry family with interests elsewhere in north Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Egger was a member of the small but wealthy group of Quakers living in Mapledurwell and Up Nately who probably worshipped at Alton where they chose to be buried in the Quaker burial ground. They are discussed in the first book published by Hampshire VCH, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/counties/hampshire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; Mapledurwell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/nately-and-andwell-probate-material-1661-1680</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four surviving wills and five inventories for this period. Two wills of widows illustrate their varied roles in the economy. Elinor Platt appears to have continued to run the family farm after the death of her husband whereas Dorothy Reeves  was retired and loaned out her savings at interest to gain an income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text.

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few wills are proved in this period of civil war and interregnum. Bishops were abolished in 1646 together with their probate courts. Southern wills should have been proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury (PCC) in this period but as the case of Bartholomew Aires demonstrates the system continued to function in Winchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written.

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven wills and seven inventories survive from this period which is dominated by the Loker family of Andwell, tenants of Winchester College at the manor farm. They were a wealthy gentry family with interests in and outside Andwell in the Basingstoke area and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

From 1932 it has been combined into one parish with neighbouring, Mapledurwell. Andwell was an extra-parochial area which was mainly owned by Winchester College as its manor of Andwell. The manor of Andwell also possessed many properties in Up Nately. Both areas were agricultural. Andwell had a mill which served the surrounding area. Brick making developed in Up Nately at the end of this period, aided by a branch of the Basingstoke canal which transported clay and bricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Up Nately and Andwell Probate Material 1581-1600</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/nately-and-andwell-probate-material-1581-1600</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealthiest testator of the 16th century was Gilbert Lookar with an inventory of c. £545. Of this inventory, £340 of goods and livestock were at Andwell and the rest were divided between Basingstoke and Worting. The value has had to be calculated as Lookar’s will was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury from where no inventory survives. However, he left all his farms of Andwell and Basingstoke to his wife, Joan, for five years. Two inventories survive for Joan in 1594: one in her own right, containing the livestock and goods left to her by Gilbert and valued at £55 and the other of her husband’s possessions which she held in trust. Unfortunately a few of the items in the inventory relating to her husband were listed but not valued. These omissions included crops in Andwell, Basingstoke and Worting. These values have been calculated using other values of crops in the inventory and in a few cases, values in other inventories of this period, giving a total of £489.65 to which the £55 of his widow’s own inventory should be added to give the total of £545. Lookar also had a house at Cliddesden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridgett Sex, executor in her husband’s (1597) and joint administrator of her son, Thomas’, estate in 1600, appears to have been married to three different men in as many years. She was named as executrix by her husband (17th February 1596-7) but appears as Bridgett Reve in her husband’s grant of probate, 5 April 1597, and Bridgett Barnard, wife of Thomas, in her son’s probate grant in 1600. Unfortunately, parish registers of Up Nately only survive from 1695.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text.

 <title>Up Nately and Andwell Probate Material 1561-80</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/nately-and-andwell-probate-material-1561-80</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only two wills survive from this period: one of a wealthy widow from Andwell mill and the other of the poor curate of the chapelry of Up Nately, whose inventory was valued at £2 7s. 2d. in 1572.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Basingstoke is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/Node/21292&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; is attached of unusual words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to the wills and inventories are below:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Up Nately and Andwell Probate Material 1541-1707</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/nately-and-andwell-probate-material-1541-1707</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wills and inventories dating from 1541-1707 have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project, based in Basingstoke. These have been transcribed from copies of the original documents which were supplied by Hampshire Record Office. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier. Names have been transcribed as written. Words in square brackets have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Words in italics were missing and have been inserted to make sense of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up Nately was a chapelry of Basing and Basingstoke in this period. From 1932 Up Nately and Mapledurwell have been combined into one parish.  VCH Hampshire&#039;s first publication of the new series of parishes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/counties/hampshire&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mapledurwell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has been published and is available for purchase from Jean Morrin. The manor of Andwell was owned by Winchester College and leased to copyholders. Andwell was extra parochial. Much of Up Nately was in the manor of Andwell but some of the parish was in the manor of Mapledurwell owned by Corpus Christi College, Oxford. For further discussion of this see the Up Nately text on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/counties/hampshire/work-in-progress/nately-and-andwell&quot;&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; section of the VCH website.&lt;/p&gt;
