 <title>Cliddesden Probate Material 1661-80</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/cliddesden-probate-material-1661-80</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extant probate material from this period includes four wills, two of which have inventories attached, and two separate inventories. Two rectors of Cliddesden and Farleigh Wallop feature amongst these records. A suggestion of plague in Cliddesden is raised by the nuncupative will of William Butler. First mention is made of books and clocks – indications of gentility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and The National Archives.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Cliddesden is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One will, one inventory and a will with inventory attached have been transcribed from this period.

&lt;p&gt;These documents have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County History project based in Basingstoke.Cliddesden is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire. It is a village just to the south of Basingstoke with many prosperous residents in the early modern period.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three wills and inventories from this period have survived.

 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/cliddesden-probate-material-1581-1600</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five wills and four inventories are extant from this period and contain examples of testators who had considerable wealth; goods and property valued at £240 in one instance and another who owned land and property in six parishes. A will and inventory of a warrener is of interest, the farming of rabbits being of local importance. Religious beliefs expressed at the start of most of these wills contain strong declarations of the Protestant faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear.

 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/cliddesden-probate-material-1561-80</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three surviving wills and inventories, all from the 1570s, reflect a mixed agricultural community. Two testators had flocks of 225 and 120 sheep respectively, as well as wheat and other arable crops. One was a beekeeper. Their opening statements of religious faith show that the Elizabethan settlement had become embedded in the parish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text.

 <title>Cliddesden Probate Material, 1541-1560</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/cliddesden-probate-material-1541-1560</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first tranche of this probate material from the years 1544-1560 is posted here and includes 10 wills and 7 inventories. The agricultural nature of the parish is amply illustrated. One testator had 360 sheep, many left sheep to the church, to their family and friends, and one widow left a bushel of wheat for the poor. Another striking feature is the religious changes indicated by the opening invocations in the wills, from a Protestant declaration in 1546 (33rd year of the reign of Henry VIII, ‘supreme head of the Church in England and defender of the faith’), to the Catholic prayers to the Virgin Mary and the Holy Company of Heaven to guide the soul through purgatory found in several wills, including 1559, the year after Mary’s reign ended. Rural communities often took time to adjust to national events. Some entries were carefully non-committal. The one clerical will, that of the rector Thomas Lodge (d. 1552), is an example of the last approach - a brief statement, ‘I commend my soul to Almighty God’.  Material wealth is evident with goods valued at over £200 in one instance and around £100 in two others.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Swing Riots and Cliddesden Convicts, 1830-1</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/swing-riots-and-cliddesden-convicts-1830-1</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the winter of 1830 unrest amongst agricultural workers spread across southern England in the face of ‘grinding poverty’.[1]  Wages were low, the price of bread high and the new threshing machines were seen as a threat to employment. Groups of men moved from farm to farm demanding higher wages and, in some cases, set fire to hay ricks and destroyed threshing machines. Letters were circulated signed by ‘Captain Swing’, the name that became associated with these short-lived but potentially revolutionary events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men from  Cliddesden were involved in two incidents. The first was on Friday 19th November when John Gold and William Astridge acted as spokesmen for a mob of some 50 labourers at Down Grange, Basingstoke, demanding money from the widow Cassandra Hankey. This was resolved peacefully with the gift of a guinea, whisky and water for all concerned and a promise by Mrs. Hankey’s bailiff to write next day to the farmers on their behalf.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second incident –with far more serious consequences -  took place on the following Monday, the 22nd. On this day Charles Bulpitt (25), John Bulpitt (23) and their younger brother Henry, together with George Clarke (25) and James Cook (28)  were involved in  a ‘great riot and disturbance’ at Wotton St Lawrence and again on Tuesday 23rd at Monk Sherborne during which sums of two sovereigns, one sovereign and a £5 promissory note were ‘stolen’.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government reaction to these riots was swift and fierce. A Special Commission was appointed to deal with the rioters in those counties most affected and the first trial took place in the Great Hall, Winchester on 20th December. Henry Bulpitt was acquitted, but Charles and John Bulpitt, George Clarke and James Cook were sentenced to death, only later commuted to transportation for life (the Bulpitts) or for 14 years (Clarke and Cook).[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men were moved from Winchester Goal to the prison hulk York at Portsmouth before sailing to New South Wales on the convict ship, the Eleanor. She sailed from Spithead on the 19th February 1831. Wives and families left behind became dependant on the parish. Esther , wife of John Bulpitt died in March 1832 (aged 20) and was buried in Cliddesden.[5] Elizabeth Cook was granted a free passage to join her husband at Parramatta, NSW, in May 1832 on the intervention of a local magistrate.[6] She later appear s to have returned to Cliddesden.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Audleys Wood, Cliddesden</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/audleys-wood-cliddesden</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audleys Wood lies in the northeast corner of Cliddesden parish, its grounds separated from Hackwood Park by the road from Basingstoke to Alton. The entrance is from this road by a tree-lined drive to the house. Originally, a second entrance existed from the Farleigh Road, the drive passing the Pensdell farm buildings. The name occurs as &lt;em&gt;Oddele&lt;/em&gt; in the thirteenth century and as &lt;em&gt;Odlease&lt;/em&gt; in 1576.[1]  The 25” Ordnance Survey map of 1870 marks the land as &lt;em&gt;Odleys Copse&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built in the 1880s of red brick with tiled roofs, the house is a mixture of styles with many antique fittings imported giving an impression of an earlier age. Major alterations were made c.1900 with the addition of a conservatory/ball-room, in 1952 when converted to a Home for the elderly and again in 1986 when the house became a hotel. It stands in extensive wooded –grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gentry house and sporting estate, owners included Thomas Pain a director of Tattersalls, the bloodstock auctioneers; William Bradshaw, a great benefactor of St Leonard’s church, Cliddesden; and three generations of the Reading brewery Simonds family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1939-45 war the house was occupied by Lord Camrose, owner and editor-in-chief of the Daily Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
