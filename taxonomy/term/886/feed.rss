 <title>Gower&#039;s Iron Foundry, Hook</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/gowers-iron-foundry-hook</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former iron foundry in Hook run by the Gower family on the London Road, opposite the Old White Hart Inn started production in 1826. It has intermittently come within Odiham and Newnham parishes, but being located in the centre of the village it employed men and boys from Hook as well as Nately Scures and Newnham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From their origins in Suffolk, the Gower family created a thriving business with award winning, innovative designs of seed drills, turnip and mangold cutters and other agricultural equipment having many distinguished customers across England. The foundry survived an arson attack in 1851 and was taken over in 1912 by the Hazell family who retained the Gower name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final closure date is unknown but in 2004 the site was sold and 74 houses built on the site named Foundry Close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a detailed history and images of some of the equipment click on the link below.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dummer&#039;s Lost Windmills</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummers-lost-windmills</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at a modern map there are no signs that Dummer ever had any windmills. By researching 18th and 19th century maps there is evidence of two. These must have been dominant in the landscape at the time and provided a valuable service to the local farmers. Documents show that grain was also brought from other parishes to be milled here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little documentation is available for Dummer Clump windmill which stood in the east of the parish on the highest point in Nutley Lane. The history of Little Manor Farm windmill is more complete, but this was destroyed in 1833 by an arson attack, possibly a victim of the Swing Riots in Hampshire at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full history of the mills and images of the maps are in the link below.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Minehead and the West Indies</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/minehead-and-west-indies</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 17th and early 18th centuries Minehead&#039;s extensive overseas trade embraced the West Indies and the names of Barbados and Jamaica were associated with the lucrative tobacco trade as well as more mundane cargoes like cured herring and potatoes. The downside was piracy and shipwreck and some Minehead men faced death far from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>52 North Street, Taunton: grocer&#039;s shop</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/52-north-street-taunton-grocers-shop</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number 52 North Street, Taunton has been a grocery store for at least 180 years. The building has medieval origins but has been virtually rebuilt several times. It was kept by grocer John Christopher Easton, a member of the famous Easton family of Bradford on Tone, better known for engineering. By 1851 he was assisted by John Barter of Kingskerswell in Devon and by 1861 the business was a partnership of Easton and Barter with Mr Easton retiring to the Priory in Taunton St James parish and John Barter living over the shop with his family, assistants and servants. Following Easton’s death in 1865 John Barter took on another Kingskerswell man John Duder a farmer’s son who had worked as a grocer in his home village. By 1870 they were partners in the business and John Barter moved out of 52 to Mount Terrace leaving the accommodation over the store to John Duder and his family and the three male staff. In 1888 the premises were greatly altered to add warehousing accommodation. John Duder died in 1911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Basingstoke Probate Material 1691-1700</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-probate-material-1691-1700</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this period the probate documents of 18 inhabitants of Basingstoke have been selected to reflect the range of occupations in the town, some show the move to brewing following the decline of the cloth industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 wills and 11 inventories have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office and The National Archives. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Basingstoke is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this period 23 probate documents have been selected to reflect the range of occupations in the town and show the move to brewing following the decline in the cloth industry.

&lt;p&gt;19 wills and 10 inventories have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke.

 <title>Basingstoke Census 1881</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-census-1881</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole of the 1881 census for Basingstoke parish has been transcribed by the New VCH Hampshire volunteers, based in the town. This information will be used for a detailed analysis of the population, households, age, occupations and migration etc. Because of the large number of inhabitants a complete spreadsheet is rather unwieldy so the data has been recorded on separate sheets, one for each of the 11 Districts enumerated. A link to the spreadsheet is below together with the enumerators’ descriptions of their walks around the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of people counted on 3rd April 1881 is 6,769 which can be compared with 4,262 residents recorded in 1851, also on line together with comments and analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-census-1851&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be remembered that this is just a snapshot of one night and many inhabitants may have been visitors, lodgers or even away from the town. Further work on the analysis of this data will be published in the future but it is interesting to note the inns (many of which are no longer in existence), employees in the clothing trade, iron foundry, breweries and railway but farmers and agricultural labourers are still evident presumably providing supplies to the town.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testamentary material that has survived from this period includes seven wills and six inventories from two yeoman, a tailor, a gentleman and his widow and two other widows. Those of William and Amy Soper of The Grange, Dummer, are of particular interest describing details of the house and possession of extensive land in several parishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office and The National Archives. Words and place names have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dummer Probate Material 1661-1680</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummer-probate-material-1661-1680</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten wills and 13 inventories survive from these years and include those of prosperous yeomen farmers, one with a flock of 450 sheep. The Compton Census of 1678 suggested an unusually high number of non-conformists in the parish and some wills in this period indicate strong Puritan beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office. Words and place names have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to the transcriptions are below. The wills of Dummer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/rectors-dummer-hampshire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rectors&lt;/a&gt; are published in a separate section of Explore.&lt;/p&gt;
