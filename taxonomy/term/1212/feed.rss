 <title>Carhampton hundred jury 1796-7</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/carhampton-hundred-jury-1796-7</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Luttrells as owners of Carhampton hundred administered the constituent tithings within their demesne manors in their manor courts but the remaining tithings were dealt with in the hundred court. Here presentments of breaches of the assize of ale, millers taking excess toll and general nuisances were presented and disputes were dealt with before a jury of male residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tithingmen were required to produce lists of all males in their tithing between the ages of 16 and 70. Many gave the occupations, place of residence and even ages of the men on their list. Curiously the lists drawn up in October 1796 and April 1797 for some tithings show great variation not only of names but of occupation and age. Farm servants, usually young men, presumably moved frequently but the disappearance of some occupations and the changes in recorded occupation are difficult to explain. Clearly some men were unsure of their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
