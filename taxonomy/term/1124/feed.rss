 <title>Rudford and Highleadon probate inventories, 1670-1784</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/rudford-and-highleadon-probate-inventories-1670-1784</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This set of 16 inventories (all that survive for this period) from the parish now known as Rudford and Highleadon was transcribed in 2012 by volunteers at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/archives/Archives-Home-Page&quot;&gt;Gloucestershire Archives&lt;/a&gt;. The work has been done in support of the Victoria County History of Gloucestershire, and will add to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/counties/gloucestershire/work-in-progress/rudford-and-highleadon&quot;&gt;draft account of the parish&lt;/a&gt;. Not surprisingly, given the rural nature of the parish, nearly all those whose occupation is given in their inventories were yeomen. There is one groom. Of the remainder, all - including three widows - can be inferred from their possessions to have been of similar farming backgrounds, of more or less substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
