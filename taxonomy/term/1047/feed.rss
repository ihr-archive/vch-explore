 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine wills and seven inventories survive for this period. the earliest two were written in Latin. They reflect a mixed farming community with sheep and crops on the Hampshire chalk downland. there is a wide range of wealth from Andrew Bernard, a gentleman, who employed servants and left goods valued at £30 to John Diming  whose goods were valued at less than £5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some wills show pre Reformation Catholic practices of leaving bequests to keep lights in front of statues lit and of prayers for the soul in purgatory and bequeathing the soul to St Mary and the Holy Company of Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written.

 <title>Upton Grey Probate Material 1500-1700</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/upton-grey-probate-material-1500-1700</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rural parish of Upton Grey is located on the north-east edge of the Hampshire chalk downland some 20 miles (32 km.) north-east of Winchester and 5 miles (8 km.) south-east of Basingstoke. The village of Upton Grey as we know it today was formed from the two Saxon manors of Odingetone (Hoddington) and Aoltone (Upton); “Grey” was added in the late 13th century. There was a church in Upton at the time of Domesday, but the present nave and Norman arch date from around 1120 and the chancel from the early 1200s. The population of the village was about 175 in the 11th century, but is now a little over 600. There is peripheral pre-historic and Roman evidence of human occupation although traces of the Roman Road from Silchester to Chichester that crossed the village between the pond and the public house are no longer visible on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;51 wills and 51 inventories survive from 1500-1700. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Hampshire is frequently described by its old name of Southampton. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Upton Grey Census 1841-1901</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/upton-grey-census-1841-1901</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upton Grey parish included the manors of Upton Grey and Hoddington. The economy depended on agriculture from which the main farmers profited and possessed large houses.  The census records reflect a rural economy dominated by farmers with their labourers and associated rural crafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 15th century Manor House is famous for its garden designed in 1908 by Gertrude Jekyll for Charles Holme, a leading figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gertrudejekyllgarden.co.uk/&quot;&gt;http://www.gertrudejekyllgarden.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Upton Grey parish church</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/upton-grey-parish-church</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;St Mary&#039;s Church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upton Grey is a small rural parish covering over 2,500 acres of mostly arable land in the chalk downland of north east Hampshire. It has 27 listed buildings, ranging from mediaeval to 18th century. In Saxon times the village of Upton Grey was two separate manors:- Aoltone (now Upton), the Grey being added in the 13th century when the manor was acquired by the de Grey family, and Odingetone (now Hoddington). The population in 1086 was about 175 in 34 dwellings and is now over 600 in some 200 dwellings.&lt;br /&gt;
	The Saxon church mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 was replaced in about 1120 in the reign of Henry 1, a son of William the Conqueror. Soon after 1200, in the reign of King John, a new chancel was added and a tower was built where the old chancel had been. A small piece of almost unreadable text has been preserved on the west wall of the tower. The lettering is English from circa 1340, which makes it extremely early for an English language text. The full wording was most likely to have been “For God’s love beware by me” and to have accompanied a purgatorial or memento mori scene. The Hoddington Aisle was built in 1715 for John Limbrey, Lord of the Hoddington Manor.&lt;br /&gt;
	During the Civil War, the churchwardens and parishioners of Upton Grey signed a certificate to the effect that most of them had suffered loss by the “spoyling of moundes” around the churchyard, and that the mounds of the church and parsonage had also suffered. This damage was caused by the soldiers quartered in the village for 12 days and nights, during the siege of Basing House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Upton Grey School</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/upton-grey-school</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1819 there were two schools in Upton Grey built on land owned by the Lord of the Manor, John Hanbury Beaufoy, which were supported on the National Plan by his wife. On one occasion she provided a roast beef dinner for nearly 300 children and gave each boy a hat and shirt and each girl a bonnet and frock. By 1870 boys and girls were combined into a single building which could accommodate 73 pupils. Children were admitted free of charge, with funding raised by government grant and voluntary rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two- or three-teacher school had two rooms measuring 15 x 14ft and 33 x 18ft. The playground was too small for proper drill lessons and play so children spilled out onto the quiet lane at break times. Children were received from neighbouring Weston Patrick when their school closed in 1917.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen evacuee children came from Portsmouth in 1939 when the village hall across the road had to be hired for senior lessons and meals. In 1941 the school was purchased by Trustees for £150 and many improvements – electricity, waterborne sanitation and a kitchen – had been made by 1958.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to falling pupil numbers, the school finally closed in 1986 with only 17 pupils on the register. In 1990 it was sold and converted into a domestic dwelling, but half of the proceeds of the sale were placed in an educational trust which still supports local students in the 21st century.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
