 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melton Mowbray&#039;s market is mentioned in Domesday Book. Agriculture, trade and food production have been important features of its economy for centuries, and today the town is famous for its pork pies and Stilton cheese. It is also hunting country, where royalty and nobility met regularly in the period between the two world wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many probate inventories survive for this town, and reveal the range of goods sold in local shops as well as the wealth of the town&#039;s traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following have been transcribed for the period 1661-1680:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Cowly, 1670&lt;/p&gt;
