 <title>Dummer War Memorial</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummer-war-memorial</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wooden lychgate at the entrance to the church yard from the street was erected in 1919 as a memorial to the 13 men of the parish who lost their lives in the First World War. It was designed by Lady Emily Rycroft, second wife to Sir Richard Nelson who lived in the village from the time of his marriage in 1911 until his death in 1925.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memorial was based on the style of a wooden porch at Boxford church in Suffolk. Although she was born in London to a military family, Lady Emily at one time lived at Edwardstone Hall (demolished in 1952), with her parents and siblings so would have known the nearby Boxford church well.[1] The timbers for the lychgate were donated by Robert Miller of Dummer Grange where an old barn was being demolished.[2] Wording on the cross beams reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those fallen in the service of their country 1914-1918.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My flesh also shall rest in hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plaque bearing the names of eight men who lost their lives in the Second World War was later added as a memorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link below gives details of the men remembered on the WWI plaques displayed on the gate. No records have as yet been found for Frederick Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a roll of honour inside the church and a stone plaque remembering the dead of WW2.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents for ten Dummer inhabitants (all men), survive for this period, eight wills and nine inventories held in Hampshire Record Office and The National Archives. Of particular interest are those of Roger Golde, clerk and Nicholas Madgwick/Madgewyke, a clothier with large quantities of kerseys in the nearby parish of Overton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words and place names have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Steventon, Hampshire,  Census Returns 1851-1901</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/steventon-hampshire-census-returns-1851-1901</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steventon was a small agricultural village mainly on the chalk of the Hampshire downs. The farming was mixed with predominantly corn and sheep but in the late 19th century cattle were increasingly raised and the importance of sheep declined slightly. After 1881 there was a resident lord of the manor, before that the village was dominated by the rector and the tenant of the Manor farm. Population increased slowly during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no station in Steventon but the London to Southampton line crossed the parish and some villagers worked on the railway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
