 <title>Old Basing Probate Material 1601 to 1620</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-probate-material-1601-1620</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probate records for 29 Old Basing residents survive for this period comprising 18 wills, 23 inventories, one court paper and two sets of accounts. Several of the documents indicate considerable wealth with land owned in neighbouring parishes and gentlemen of high status, some owning weapons. Farming is dominant as would be expected on the chalk which dominates in the south of the parish. Much of the north of the parish lies on clay soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fuller&#039;s inventory of 1602 reflected the continuing importance of the local cloth industry. Other inventories contained spinning and weaving equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John White (d.1608) was very interesting as he was a gentleman and member of the Marquis of Winchester&#039;s staff with interests across southern England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents have been transcribed by the wills group of the Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke working from copies of original probate documents supplied by The National Archives and Hampshire Record Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Old Basing (Basing) Probate Material 1581-1600</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-basing-probate-material-1581-1600</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this period 21 wills, 26 inventories and one court paper survive. Mostly, these are held in Hampshire Record Office but with one in the National Archives. They show the local mixed farming community with cattle, sheep and crops. Some of the farms were on the clay soil in the north of the parish and others on the chalk in the south. One prominent faming family were the Mulfords for six of whom probate documents survive. Associated rural trades are also recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Old Basing is described as Basing being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Old Basing (Basing) Probate Material 1561-1580</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-basing-probate-material-1561-1580</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen wills and inventories survive for this period, all are in Hampshire Record Office. They reflect the local farming community and related rural trades. A number of wills were made by the Mulford family, some of whom were clearly prominent in local society, such as Leonard who died in in 1573 in possession of a number of weapons including two swords. Two testators provided for their widows to lose their bequests if they remarried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The south of the parish is on the Hampshire chalk with sheep and corn, while the north is on the clay and supports more dairy farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wills and inventories survive for Old Basing in Hampshire Record Office (HRO) and The National Archives (TNA). These are being transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke and will be published in the near future. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Old Basing is described as Basing being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Old Basing (Basing) Probate Material 1541-60</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-basing-probate-material-1541-60</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty four wills and 22 inventories survive for this period of people involved in the local farming community and related trades. Virtually all the surviving wills reflect the pre-Reformation Catholic society with the souls of testators left to the Lady Saint Mary and the Holy Company of Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six testators died in 1557 and seven in 1558 which may reflect a local epidemic of the sweating sickness or the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wills and inventories survive for Old Basing in Hampshire Record Office (HRO) and The National Archives (TNA). These are being transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke and will be published in the near future. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Old Basing is described as Basing being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Old Basing (Basing) Probate Material 1521 to 1700</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-basing-probate-material-1521-1700</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of the parish of Old Basing lies on chalk, with the sands and gravels of the Reading beds running through the centre of the village from NW to SE, separating the chalk uplands (up to 100m OD) in the south from the low-lying London clays (c.60m OD). The river Loddon flows from the chalk just west of Basingstoke through the village towards Reading, the River Lyde, another eventual tributary of the Thames, touches the parish on the south and east. Petty’s Brook, another tributary, forms part of the boundary. The variety of soils has had an impact on the agricultural richness of the parish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parish is not heavily wooded, most of the woodland being on the clay soils, or plantations within Hackwood Park in the south. The river Loddon has determined the form of the village which grew up mainly on the south bank above the flood plain between the two best crossing points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basing parish had four manors: Basing, Byfleet, Hackwood and Lychpit. One of the earliest references to the place-name is the Battle of Basing in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 871 when Alfred (before he became king) was defeated by the Danes. In Domesday, it formed part of the holding of Hugh de Port, the family who retained lordship living in Basing for a long time. It passed to the Paulet family and William Paulet in the 16th century rose to great heights in the government and rebuilt Basing House so that it became the grandest private residence in the land, visited by all the Tudor monarchs. In the 17th century it was famous for the stalwart defence of the house for King Charles during the civil wars by the fifth Marquis John Paulet. It was finally taken by Oliver Cromwell in October 1645 and was completely destroyed by Act of Parliament. It is said that houses in the village were built using bricks from Basing House. In the 18th century, the main Hampshire seat of the family, by then Dukes of Bolton, moved across the park to Hackwood House, which is not in Basing parish. The estate remained an entity until the mid 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wills and inventories survive for Old Basing in Hampshire Record Office (HRO) and The National Archives (TNA). These are being transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke and will be published in the near future.

 <title>Congregationalism in Old Basing: Pyotts Hill Chapel c.1868-1943</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/congregationalism-old-basing-pyotts-hill-chapel-c1868-1943</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not known exactly when the Congregational cause in the parish of Old Basing was instituted, but it was already in existence at the time of the &lt;em&gt;1851 Census of Religious Worship&lt;/em&gt;. The census return records that the Independents (Congregationalists) of the parish worshipped at Cottage House, Basing, which was described as a ‘Dwelling House’ that was ‘not used exclusively for worship’. Fifty were present at the afternoon service on the day of the census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some years after the census, a permanent place of worship was constructed in the Pyotts Hill district of the parish. However, there is some uncertainty as to the year in which this occurred. According to &lt;em&gt;White’s Directory&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Hampshire&lt;/em&gt; it was 1868, and in the records of the Hampshire Congregational Union, 1872. It cost £200 and could accommodate 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the early years of the twentieth century the chapel was described as having ‘good congregations and an all-alive appearance’. There was an afternoon and evening service every Sunday and ‘a midweek preaching service.’ It also had a ‘flourishing’ Sunday school; a branch of the Band of Hope; and a well regarded choir. In 1912 the premises were renovated by voluntary effort and in 1914 an additional room was added to the chapel to facilitate its provision for young men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the outbreak of War did not adversely affect the situation beyond making it more difficult for preachers to get to the chapel due to petrol shortages. Nonetheless, a service was held every Sunday until the winter of 1941 when it was decided to suspend services for three months, a sign that all was not well. That said, following their suspension services were resumed with a statement being made that there was no intention of permanent closure. However, by mid-1943 it was clear that with dwindling numbers this was to be the ultimate fate of the chapel. Accordingly, as Revd Wilfrid Salmon, London Street’s minister, regretfully pointed out after 71 years it was necessary to close the chapel with the last service being held in September 1943. At the time it was felt that the Methodist Church in the centre of the village was in a better position to meet Free Church needs. The Congregational chapel building was subsequently used as a warehouse and in the mid-1950s converted into residential accommodation, which continues to be the position in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lutyens&#039; Daneshill House, Lychpit, Old Basing</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/lutyens-daneshill-house-lychpit-old-basing</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Daneshill, 1 m. NW By Lutyens, 1903. Brick, Tudor and conventional.&#039;&lt;/strong&gt;[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These spare words of Pevsner are all there seemed to be said about Daneshill at a time (the 1960s) when Lutyens’ work was considered too populist to be really accepted. Now, with more interest in English vernacular architecture and the ever-present danger of losing large country houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, we can place Lutyens within the story of the modern house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daneshill House used to be a landmark building highly visible on the ridge above Swing Swang Lane, Lychpit near Old Basing but is now obscured by trees. It is one of a cluster of buildings designed by Lutyens – the Daneshill Brick and Tile Works office building in Bilton Road, the Lodge in Daneshill Drive and Daneshill Cottage, later known as Daneshill Court in Lutyens Close, which after a spell as a retirement home suffered vandalism and then a disastrous fire in 2007 while vacant. The Cottage, Lodge (a private home) and Brickworks buildings are Listed Grade II. The name Daneshill, cooked up by Lutyens and his client, Walter Hoare, was chosen as the area is close to the site of a battle of 871 between the Danes and the Saxons. The name ‘Lychpit’ almost certainly comes from the place where the bodies were buried after the battle. It is an ancient site – 5 Bronze Age burial urns were found here when the commercial site was being developed.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a new initiative to prevent the spread of infectious diseases from dirty conditions following the Diseases Prevention Act of 1855; the link between dirty water and bad sanitation and diseases like cholera had been accepted, although the mechanism was not understood. Union Medical Officers all over England were sent out into their Districts to report on the sanitary conditions of the people in their parishes, and fortunately their reports are copied into the Minute Books of Basingstoke Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports give a revealing insight into the living conditions of ordinary people in much of this rural Union in 1866, some statistics on illness and mortality, and including odd bits of information on specific locations and parishes, distribution of cottages and their occupation, land drainage and sanitary conditions in Monk Sherborne and Worting village schools. Each doctor has his own style of reporting, but the resulting outcomes are basically the same - things were grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports for the town of Basingstoke are presented in a separate item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports for the Districts of the Union with their parishes are transcribed here, with an index page. Note that some place names are in contemporary spelling and are different from modern ones.&lt;/p&gt;
