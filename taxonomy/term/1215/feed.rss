 <title>Dummer Boundary and Milestones</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummer-boundary-and-milestones</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local trusts were obliged to erect milestones on turnpike roads by law in 1773. Some of these stone markers can still be seen along many main roads. Dummer has three such stones on its western boundary on the A30, all of which are Grade II Listed monuments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boundary stones are less common but Dummer has two that survive on the edge of woodland demarking its parish from that of Popham and the Candovers.  Boundaries were inspected by meresmen who would agree the extent of the parish with neighbouring officials and check the condition of ditches, hedges and fences. The old custom of beating the bounds dates back to the importance of passing on the knowledge of the parish limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link below contains photographs and a more detailed account of the stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dummer&#039;s Lost Windmills</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummers-lost-windmills</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at a modern map there are no signs that Dummer ever had any windmills. By researching 18th and 19th century maps there is evidence of two. These must have been dominant in the landscape at the time and provided a valuable service to the local farmers. Documents show that grain was also brought from other parishes to be milled here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little documentation is available for Dummer Clump windmill which stood in the east of the parish on the highest point in Nutley Lane. The history of Little Manor Farm windmill is more complete, but this was destroyed in 1833 by an arson attack, possibly a victim of the Swing Riots in Hampshire at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full history of the mills and images of the maps are in the link below.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dummer Water Supply</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummer-water-supply</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dummer village benefitted from a clean and reliable water supply due to its location on chalk with clear springs and also from the generosity and innovation of the lord of the manor living in Dummer House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells, standpipes and taps were situated in the two main streets for general use fed by a system of pipes leading from underground tanks. One well is of particular interest as it is protected by a Grade II Listed well house and contains a large treadwheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately wells were dangerous places and there are two reports of children falling down the shafts and one of an adult who committed suicide by lowering himself into a well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a detailed report on the Dummer water supply with photographs and maps, click the link below.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dummer Probate Material 1661-1680</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummer-probate-material-1661-1680</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten wills and 13 inventories survive from these years and include those of prosperous yeomen farmers, one with a flock of 450 sheep. The Compton Census of 1678 suggested an unusually high number of non-conformists in the parish and some wills in this period indicate strong Puritan beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office. Words and place names have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written.

 <title>Dummer Probate Material 1641-1660</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummer-probate-material-1641-1660</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six wills and two inventories survive for this period, held in the Hampshire Record Office (HRO) and The National Archives (TNA). They include those of two yeomen, a gentleman, a clerk (rector) and two widows. This is the time of the civil war (1642-51) and commonwealth (1649-60).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Dummer is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>1939 National Register for Dummer</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/1939-national-register-dummer</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The National Register of 1939&lt;/strong&gt;[1] shows the occupations of Dummer residents (population 360 ) to consist largely of those associated with the land (landowner, farmer, smallholder, labourer, gardener, market gardener, forestry worker, gamekeeper, shepherd, cowman, poultryman, carter, sawyer and tractor driver), in trades related to an agricultural economy (carpenter, wheelwright, blacksmith, haulage contractor, brick layer) and in services supporting the community (grocer, shopkeeper, roundsman, newsagent, plumber/pipe layer, inn keeper, bus proprietor, petrol station owner and road labourer). Four men worked at an aeronautical instrument maker, one each as a telephone linesman engineer, a paper mill hand and a watchman at a motor works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional and government officers included the rector, an undersecretary of state for agriculture, elementary school teacher, sub-postmistress, government officer (health) and a police constable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women were largely recorded as unpaid domestic workers in their own homes with the exceptions of a foster mother, a café assistant, a tailoress in a clothing factory, a school cleaner and a small number who were employed as domestic servants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic service was limited to six properties: Dummer Grange where there was a butler/chauffeur, gardener, two domestic servants and a children’s nurse; Dummer House with a groom, chauffeur/gardener, cook, parlourmaid and housemaid; Clump House with a cook and housemaid; the Rectory, Dummer Down farm and Dummer Grange farm each with one domestic servant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golf course established in 1928 gave rise to the new occupations of professional golfer, stewardess and groundsman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty children, twelve retirees, five invalids and four people of independent means are listed in the register but 81 entries are blanked out (listed as A.N.Other) and relate to residents who may still be alive in 2018 and whose identity is protected under the 100 year rule. The total number of children may be assumed to have been very much higher than shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dummer register was compiled by Gertrude Maud Weekes on 14 October 1939, a few weeks after the outbreak of World War 11. It identifies 15 ARP wardens, four Red Cross members, three Special Constables, a Billeting Office and a Land Army organiser as well as the first evacuee. Dubbed ‘The Wartime Domesday Book’ it is said to be the most comprehensive survey of the population of England and Wales ever undertaken. The National Registration Act, 1939 which ordered the register introduced compulsory identity cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images of an original registration card are below as well as the transcription of the register.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dummer Probate Material 1601-1620</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five wills and seven inventories survive for this period. Mixed farming on the chalk downs is evident with sheep and corn predominating and the wool trade apparent with a weaver having the highest value inventory. Declarations of faith reflected the Protestant beliefs of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke working from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Basingstoke is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten wills and 12 inventories survive for this period including several husbandmen and yeomen and some of the prominent families in the parish reflecting substantial farming activity and wealth.
