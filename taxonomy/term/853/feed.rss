 <title>Dummer&#039;s Lost Windmills</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummers-lost-windmills</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at a modern map there are no signs that Dummer ever had any windmills. By researching 18th and 19th century maps there is evidence of two. These must have been dominant in the landscape at the time and provided a valuable service to the local farmers. Documents show that grain was also brought from other parishes to be milled here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little documentation is available for Dummer Clump windmill which stood in the east of the parish on the highest point in Nutley Lane. The history of Little Manor Farm windmill is more complete, but this was destroyed in 1833 by an arson attack, possibly a victim of the Swing Riots in Hampshire at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full history of the mills and images of the maps are in the link below.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>52 North Street, Taunton: grocer&#039;s shop</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/52-north-street-taunton-grocers-shop</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number 52 North Street, Taunton has been a grocery store for at least 180 years. The building has medieval origins but has been virtually rebuilt several times. It was kept by grocer John Christopher Easton, a member of the famous Easton family of Bradford on Tone, better known for engineering. By 1851 he was assisted by John Barter of Kingskerswell in Devon and by 1861 the business was a partnership of Easton and Barter with Mr Easton retiring to the Priory in Taunton St James parish and John Barter living over the shop with his family, assistants and servants. Following Easton’s death in 1865 John Barter took on another Kingskerswell man John Duder a farmer’s son who had worked as a grocer in his home village. By 1870 they were partners in the business and John Barter moved out of 52 to Mount Terrace leaving the accommodation over the store to John Duder and his family and the three male staff. In 1888 the premises were greatly altered to add warehousing accommodation. John Duder died in 1911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Basingstoke Probate Material 1691-1700</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-probate-material-1691-1700</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this period the probate documents of 18 inhabitants of Basingstoke have been selected to reflect the range of occupations in the town, some show the move to brewing following the decline of the cloth industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 wills and 11 inventories have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office and The National Archives. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Basingstoke is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to the documents are below and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/Node/21292&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;glossary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is attached of unusual words.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Basingstoke Probate Material 1681-1690</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-probate-material-1681-1690</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this period 23 probate documents have been selected to reflect the range of occupations in the town and show the move to brewing following the decline in the cloth industry. Three documents relate to the wealthy Acton family and two to men serving the town’s medical needs – an apothecary and a surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 wills and 10 inventories have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office and The National Archives. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written.

 <title>Basingstoke Census 1881</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-census-1881</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole of the 1881 census for Basingstoke parish has been transcribed by the New VCH Hampshire volunteers, based in the town. This information will be used for a detailed analysis of the population, households, age, occupations and migration etc. Because of the large number of inhabitants a complete spreadsheet is rather unwieldy so the data has been recorded on separate sheets, one for each of the 11 Districts enumerated. A link to the spreadsheet is below together with the enumerators’ descriptions of their walks around the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of people counted on 3rd April 1881 is 6,769 which can be compared with 4,262 residents recorded in 1851, also on line together with comments and analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-census-1851&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be remembered that this is just a snapshot of one night and many inhabitants may have been visitors, lodgers or even away from the town. Further work on the analysis of this data will be published in the future but it is interesting to note the inns (many of which are no longer in existence), employees in the clothing trade, iron foundry, breweries and railway but farmers and agricultural labourers are still evident presumably providing supplies to the town.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this decade a selection of 18 probate records comprising 12 wills, 12 inventories and one renunciation have been chosen from the available material because of their occupations, reflecting the woollen industry and diversification of other trades in the town.

 <title>Wallis and Steevens Engineering Company, Basingstoke 1856-1981</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/wallis-and-steevens-engineering-company-basingstoke-1856-1981</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wallis and Steevens was a family business, founded in Basingstoke in 1856 to sell agricultural machinery in the rural hinterland. By the 1880s they marketed Basingstoke built machines world-wide. In the 20th century, the company manufactured road rollers for the home and export markets and guaranteed their market share by major design innovations in the 1920s and 1960s. The company closed its Basingstoke business at Daneshill  in July 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engine to the left (works no. 7498, reg. no. HO 5629), was manufactured in 1916 for the Ministry of Munitions and was used on various duties associated with WW1 including hay tying of fodder for horses which was then shipped to fighting forces in Europe.  In 1951 it was working in Duncton Quarry, Petworth, Sussex where conditions caused excessive wear and tear on its gears. In 1958 it was offered to the National Traction Engine Club to help raise funds for its restoration. A raffle was held which was won by a teenage boy who chose to have the £100 cash prize instead as his family had nowhere to keep the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1963 to 1977 it stood unused with various owners until 2002 when extensive restoration began and it made its first working appearance in June 2008. This photograph was taken in June 2018 at the Bloxham Steam Rally, Oxfordshire where it was driving a log sawing bench.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Overton Markets and Fairs</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/overton-markets-and-fairs</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article traces the history of the fairs and markets from 1218 to the present day, including the commodities traded, how the markets were regulated and the revenues due to the Bishop of Winchester as lord of the manor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, the annual sheep fair was moved from the main street to a more convenient field and the local gentry formed an ‘Overton Sheep Fair Society’ with prizes for the best entries and a sumptuous dinner. Both initiatives resulted in a substantial increase in business with up to 100,000 animals changing hands. As with all the country fairs, however, the coming of the railways eventually resulted in its demise, as the sellers moved their sheep by rail to the major cities where prices were higher. The associated pleasure fair was revived in 2000. It is held every four years and attracts thousands of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Mary Sweet and her Hotel</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/mary-sweet-and-her-hotel</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Sweet was the creator of the western side of the present Castle Hotel, Taunton in the 1830s. She gave Taunton probably its first luxury hotel. She was one of many female hoteliers in Somerset in the mid 19th century creating high-class family hotels often out of traditional inns or as  in Mary’s case creating a new business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Basingstoke Post Offices 1808-1971</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-post-offices-1808-1971</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Post Office in Basingstoke was run by Robert Cottle, Chief Magistrate, from 1808. The Penny Post was introduced in 1840 which coincided with the arrival of the railway to the town. The postal service thus became accessible to the general public with regular collections and deliveries at an affordable price. On Cottle’s retirement the business transferred to premises in Wote Street and as the service grew, a bespoke building was erected in New Street in 1925.  This served as the town’s main Post Office until 1971 when a larger office was built in London Street and the sorting office transferred to Priestley Road in 1978.  (See the asset below for a full history.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
