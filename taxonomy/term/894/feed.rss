 <title>Dummer Water Supply</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dummer-water-supply</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dummer village benefitted from a clean and reliable water supply due to its location on chalk with clear springs and also from the generosity and innovation of the lord of the manor living in Dummer House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells, standpipes and taps were situated in the two main streets for general use fed by a system of pipes leading from underground tanks. One well is of particular interest as it is protected by a Grade II Listed well house and contains a large treadwheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately wells were dangerous places and there are two reports of children falling down the shafts and one of an adult who committed suicide by lowering himself into a well.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Roughmoor mill</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/roughmoor-mill</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other Bishops Hull mills Roughmoor mill was not on the river Tone but on one of its northern tributaries. Like many mills in the area it had many uses over its history from cloth production to flour milling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Bishops Hull Mills</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/bishops-hull-mills</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medieval manor mill at Bishops Hull went out of use in the 1340s but by the late 16th century the parish was home to a large number of mills, all but one on the river Tone. Frethey mill was in use from the mid 16th to early 18th centuries and Burchin mill, a former fulling mill, was a grain mill by 1585 but was ruinous by the 1780s.  Like all rural mills near Taunton they suffered competition from the development of the medieval manor mills near the Castle into the Town Mills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>The Gunfleet Estuary and Holland Haven</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/gunfleet-estuary-and-holland-haven</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gunfleet was the name of the large estuary fed by the Holland River or brook, which formerly ran into the sea between Frinton and Little Holland. The name is probably Anglo-Saxon in origin, as the second element ‘fleet’ is derived from the Old English word fleot meaning ‘stream’ or ‘creek’. A similar well known example is the River Fleet in London, a tributary of the River Thames which was fed by streams on Hampstead Heath and which used to have a tidal inlet and docks at its lower end. The origin of the first element of the name ‘Gun’ is currently unknown, but it possibly derived from an Anglo-Saxon personal name, so the meaning of the whole name could be something like ‘Gunna’s creek’. An alternative suggestion that has been made is that the first part of the name could be a corruption from the Count of Guisnes who possessed the manor of Little Holland in 1210.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the name was not recorded until 1320 when a vessel was shipwrecked on ‘Gunfletsond’, that is to say the Gunfleet Sands. It seems probable that a name originally applying to the estuary was appended to the sandbank that lay directly off the coast and opposite the estuary’s inlet. A map of 1584 in the British Library marks both the ‘Gonflet haven’ (the estuary) and the ‘ye gonflit’ (the sandbank). Other maps from that period, such as maps of Essex by Norden (1594) and Speed (1610) show the Gunfleet as a large, unreclaimed, estuary that was open to the sea at its southern end. The use of the name ‘haven’ would seem to imply the use of the estuary for trade, and the ‘Ganflete’ was also named as a port between Walton and St Osyth in Holinshed’s Chronicles (1586). The substantial marshlands along the estuary were also used by the inhabitants of surrounding parishes like Great and Little Holland as grazing for their sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1542 ‘the level of Gunflete haven’ was recorded, perhaps indicating that estuary’s marshland later known as Holland Levels had started to be reclaimed. Although the estuary continued to be marked on coastal maps and sea charts for a long time, it was becoming blocked perhaps by the effects of coastal erosion and long-shore drift. In 1677 a whale was stranded in the narrows at what was probably the entrance to the Gunfleet estuary then described as a ‘creek’. Probably soon afterwards it was decided to reclaim the estuary by constructing a sea wall across its mouth, with a sluice provided to allow the river water to drain away to sea. The intention was to prevent salt water entering the marshes along the Holland River, and thus to improve their agricultural potential and value. It is not known when the first wall was built, but in 1703 a survey was taken of ‘ye Levell or Flatts being several pieces or parcells of land endamaged by a breach at, or near Gunfleet Haven’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records of the Tendring Levels Commissioners, a type of local government body charged with flood defence, survive from 1727 and show how they maintained the drained marshlands of the level, the sea wall and the sluice through which the Holland River then emptied into the open sea. By the 1760s the area was sufficiently drained to allow a new road link to cross the former estuary from Holland on Sea to Great Holland, although the extensive tracts of land were still liable to flood as shown by the marshes depicted on the Chapman and André map of 1777 and the one inch Ordnance Survey map (1838 edition). The Commissioners continued to be responsible for maintaining the sea wall and the Levels until the 1930s, and their maps reveal the outline of the old estuary through the land that had to pay rates to maintain the sea defences.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Morwenstow holy wells</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/morwenstow-holy-wells</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morwenstow had two holy wells, dedicated to the two patron saints of its church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately St Morwenna&#039;s well in the cliff face is now inaccessible and faces destruction from the constant erosion of the sea cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St John&#039;s well is not far from the church but is locked up and disused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Minehead&#039;s water supply</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any community Minehead needed water and this was traditionally supplied by springs and streams and later also from wells but the growth in tourism strained resources to breaking point and it is no coincidence that the Minehead Waterworks Company was formed in 1874, the year the railway arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Dunster&#039;s water supplies</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/dunsters-water-supplies</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water is not only vital for life and domestic comfort but for centuries was the main source of power for much of England&#039;s industry. It has always been a source of dispute over ownership, availability, cost and pollution. Once used water also presents problems of disposal and has itself long been used to dispose of waste. Dunster preserves a surprsing amount of evidence of the history of its water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>BASINGSTOKE TOWN, SANITARY CONDITIONS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE  IN 1866</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-town-sanitary-conditions-and-infectious-disease-1866</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pages were missing from the Minute Books of the Basingstoke Poor Law Union in 1866, where the reports for the outlying parishes were transcribed in full (see separate item on VCH Explore), but turned up in The National Archives inserted into the correspondence for September 1871, along with William Ranger&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Report to the General Board of Health on the Borough of Basingstoke&lt;/em&gt; of 1853 and Dr Ballard&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Report upon the Sanitary Condition of Basingstoke&lt;/em&gt; of 1871.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three items were undoubtedly grouped together because in 1871 sanitary conditions in Basingstoke - as in many Victorian towns and cities - were particularly bad. With the new Local Government Board, the new Urban Sanitary Authority (the Town Council) and the Rural Sanitary Authority (Basingstoke Poor Law Union) were established, and they became involved in trying to deal with this; consequently these items co-exist along with copious amounts of correspondence relating to the problem, which inevitably involved bad conditions in the Basingstoke Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, on its own, is a subject for further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TNA, MH 12/10683,  Correspondence between the Local Government Board and Basingstoke Union, 1871 to 1872 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Sanitary Inspectors&#039; Reports in Basingstoke Union in the 1860s showing conditions and infectious disease</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/sanitary-inspectors-reports-basingstoke-union-1860s-showing-conditions-and-infectious-disease</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a new initiative to prevent the spread of infectious diseases from dirty conditions following the Diseases Prevention Act of 1855; the link between dirty water and bad sanitation and diseases like cholera had been accepted, although the mechanism was not understood. Union Medical Officers all over England were sent out into their Districts to report on the sanitary conditions of the people in their parishes, and fortunately their reports are copied into the Minute Books of Basingstoke Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports give a revealing insight into the living conditions of ordinary people in much of this rural Union in 1866, some statistics on illness and mortality, and including odd bits of information on specific locations and parishes, distribution of cottages and their occupation, land drainage and sanitary conditions in Monk Sherborne and Worting village schools. Each doctor has his own style of reporting, but the resulting outcomes are basically the same - things were grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports for the town of Basingstoke are presented in a separate item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports for the Districts of the Union with their parishes are transcribed here, with an index page. Note that some place names are in contemporary spelling and are different from modern ones.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>River Avill</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/river-avill</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river Avill, famous for the snowdrop valley near its source, is small but significant. It is crossed by many ancient bridges and formerly powered several mills before discharging itself into the Bristol Channel at the former Dunster Haven. North of Dunster it is largely man made but to the south its beautiful valley is lined with woods and pastures and provides a route for the only significant north-south road in Exmoor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
