 <title>Up Nately and Andwell Probate Material 1561-80</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/nately-and-andwell-probate-material-1561-80</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only two wills survive from this period: one of a wealthy widow from Andwell mill and the other of the poor curate of the chapelry of Up Nately, whose inventory was valued at £2 7s. 2d. in 1572.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Basingstoke is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/Node/21292&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; is attached of unusual words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to the wills and inventories are below:&lt;/p&gt;
