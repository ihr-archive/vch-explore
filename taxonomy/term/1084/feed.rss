 <title>Fulling and Finishing</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/fulling-and-finishing-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weaving, cloth had to be fulled to shrink and strengthen the fabric, providing greater resistance to wear and weather. The process originally involved immersing the cloth in a trough filled with water and chemicals (such as fuller’s earth and urine), which helped remove any grease or dirt, and compressing it by foot or hand. The introduction of water-powered fulling mills in the later 12th century mechanised and speeded up the process, with two wooden hammers replacing human effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Sheep and wool processing</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/sheep-and-wool-processing-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheep farming was an important part of the Cotswolds economy by the Roman period. Medieval Cotswold sheep were a distinctive breed, producing fine white wool which was highly valued for cloth manufacture: in the 15th century, out of 50 grades of wool produced by English sheep that of the Cotswold ranked third. Probably they were smaller than modern breeds: long-necked and fine-limbed, with short curly fleeces and a woolly forelock from which the nickname ‘Cotswold Lion’ derived. Certainly their fleeces weighed far less than their modern counterparts, about 1½ pounds compared with 9 pounds or more. Medieval fleeces were sold by the sack, each of which weighed 364 pounds and contained the wool of some 240 sheep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
