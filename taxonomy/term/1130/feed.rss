 <title>Trowbridge Industry</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/trowbridge-industry</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town was held by Brictric, a Saxon in 1086 after his father had held it at the conquest of William the conqueror in 1066. Brictric was the most important Saxon landowner in Wiltshire therefore showing us that Trowbridge was a desirable settlement to own in this period of time. The settlement had increased economic activity in the 13th century as the building of the castle, the holding of honour courts, the presence of a garrison and at times of the baron and his retinue all were an economic burden on the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town’s staple trade is the cloth industry and it began in the 15th century although the prosperity of this trade would last several centuries. John Leland came to Trowbridge shortly after 1543 he was impressed by the towns trade when he stated ‘the towne flourishith by drapery.’ The prosperity of certain individuals at this time can be realised when looking at the vast personal wealth that they held. When Thomas Bailey, a clothman died in 1543 he left 1000 marks to his wife and vestments to the churches of Wingfield and Keevil. The quality of his grand house also needs to be considered as his fine timber-framed house survived for four centuries after his death; it was located in Fore Street.        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloth industry continued to be the town’s main employment trade into the 20th century and mills sprung up in and around the town. Trowbridge was known as the Manchester of the west and exported its cloth worldwide. Unfortunately the industry declined in the later 20th century and the mills was demolished and they could no longer achieve a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Trowbridge Chartists</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/trowbridge-chartists</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chartism was nationwide movement for voting reform in Victorian England. The first Chartist demonstration in Trowbridge took place on the 19th November 1838 when 3000 people marched by torchlight from the disused barracks to the town centre. The absence of the military from the town encouraged the chartists to hold large meetings of men and women there in 1839. The influence of the notable Trowbridge Chartist William Carrier made the town the centre of Wiltshire’s Chartism, before he was arrested on 7th June 1839.  In the winter of 1839-40 collections were raised for the Chartists and their causes. In 1842, 2 delegates from Trowbridge were sent to the universal suffrage conference in Birmingham and Fergus O Conner the leader of the Chartists visited Trowbridge himself. The last recorded meeting of the chartists was in November 1845 before the movement died out after contributing to the growth of political democracy.                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Lansdown was born in Trowbridge in 1819 and was the son of a woollen mill employee. Benjamin did not enjoy this line of work; so he was apprenticed as a printer with Mr John Sweet, the Trowbridge printer whose grandfather Edward had set up the first printing press in the town around 1760. In 1853 he took over his former masters business buying his hard press and type for £12 10s 0d. In the following year he started his newspaper The Wiltshire Times in his printing shop on Church Street. He established a newspaper and stationer shop at number 6 Silver Street in 1860 and moved his printing shop to Duke Street in 1876. Before his death in 1884 he had taken his sons James and George into partnership.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Trowbridge Barracks</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/trowbridge-barracks</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trowbridge Barracks was erected in Bradley Road in 1794 by contractor John Scobell. A troop of cavalry was stationed in building, which housed 4 officers, 58 soldiers of other ranks, 63 horses and had hospital accommodation for 10. The barracks was abandoned after the close of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Troops returned to Trowbridge in 1826 and were billeted in the town’s inns. This was unpopular and in 1837 a petition demanded that neighbouring towns should share the cost. Six-monthly quartering’s in Trowbridge, Bradford upon Avon and Frome were introduced in 1838. Because of the Chartist disturbances 1838-9, the Government decided to provide proper military quarters and bought back the barracks in 1839. From the late 19th century the barracks housed the Royal Artillery.  By 1903 the barracks could hold 150 men; it was extended in the 2nd World War but was later demolished and replaced with housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boer Wars occurred in South Africa and took place between the British and the descendants of the Dutch settlers. The first war dates from 1880 -1 while the second dates 1899-1902. The Wars resulted in a British victory as the Boer Republics were brought to an end in the peace settlement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
