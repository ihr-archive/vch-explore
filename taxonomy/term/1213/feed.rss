 <title>Land ownership in Buckminster and Sewstern</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/land-ownership-buckminster-and-sewstern</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parish of Buckminster, which includes the two villages of Buckminster and Sewstern, is in north-east Leicestershire, and adjoins the county of Lincolnshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two manors of Buckminster and Sewstern were purchased in 1763 by Lord William Manners, a younger son of the second Duke of Rutland. His eldest son and heir John Manners married Lady Louisa Talmash, the eldest daughter of the 4th Earl of Dysart (in the Scottish peerage), who became Countess of Dysart in her own right following the deaths of her brothers Lionel (5th earl, died 1799) and Wilbraham (6th earl, died 1840). Land purchases by this family, especially in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, created a large estate, centred on Buckminster Park, the hall built by William Saxton for Sir William Manners in c. 1794. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Buckminster Probate Material</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/buckminster-probate-material</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckminster stands on high ground in east Leicestershire, 10 miles north-east of Melton Mowbray and close to the county borders with Lincolnshire and Rutland. As the place-name suggests, there was a Saxon minster here, although the present church of St John the Baptist does not appear to contain any work before the 13th century. Around three-quarters of the land is pasture and was enclosed in 1597. In 1842 the Earl of Dysart owned 1,359 acres of the 1,796 acres in the township. Apart from a brief period between 1866 and 1936 the parish also included the township of Sewstern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probate records are gradually being transcribed for Buckminster, and will be added to this page as work progresses. There are 29 surviving probate inventories covering the period 1634-1811, with an average (mean) value of £88 13s. and a median of £39 10s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate page has been created for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/sewstern-probate-material&quot;&gt;Sewstern probate material&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
