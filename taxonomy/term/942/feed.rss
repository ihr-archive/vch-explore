 <title>Aylesford</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/aylesford</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large village of Aylesford lies in the Medway Valley, Kent. The village grew up on the north bank of the river Medway, where a steep-sided knoll provided a strategic site for a church. The river also narrowed sufficiently at the point to allow for the construction of a stone-built bridge in the 14th century. Housing developed on the north bank of the river, its nucleus between church and bridge. Aylesford was once a distinct, seperated community, having very different traditions and peculiarities from it&#039;s neighbouring villages, despite their shared farming heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prehistoric landscape, surrounding Aylesford, was often given mythical significance through the identification of the barrows as the resting place of Catigern adn Horsa, believed to have been killed in battle between the Britons and Saxons nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two principal medieval estates in the parish. In 1240 a Carmelite priory had been established a quarter of a mile west of the church, close to the north bank of the Medway. The builings and lands of the Carmelites formed the post-Dissolution estate known as The Friars, owned from the later 16th century by the Sedley family,and in 1657 acquired by Caled Banks of Maidstone. Sir John Banks, Caleb&#039;s son, amassed great wealth as a merchant in London. Hus eldest daughter married Heneage Finch, son of the Earl of Nottingham. Finch inherited The Friars estate and was in 1714 created Earl of Aylesford. Successive earls continued to hold The Friars and lands in the northern half of the parish until 1882, but they never lived in Aylesford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aylesford grew wealthy in the late 17th century, due to it&#039;s importance as a bridging point over the river Medway. However, this growth was slow due to the control exercised over development by the two main landowning families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing in the area was rather lacking, as the high number of lodgers suggests. In 1861, 12.1 per cent of the parish population was recorded as either boarding or lodging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the mid to late 17th century, Aylesford contributed very little to charity compared to the surrounding villages in the Medway Valley area. In 1865, the Parish Officers of Aylesford &#039;disposed of&#039; £6 4s. to the poor, sick, widows and infirm, after collecting a fine of one shilling from members who arrived late to their montlty meetings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1851, Aylesford&#039;s population reached 1,487. However, over the next 50 years this number almost doubled, mostly moving into the new settlements built in Pratling Street and Forstal, as well as the new housing built beside the existing industry at Millhall. In the late 19th century, many of the parishioners of Aylesford found employment at the paper-mill and at the brick and pottery works.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cuxton censuses: 1841, 1861, 1881, 1901</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/cuxton-censuses-1841-1861-1881-1901</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cuxton censuses for 1841, 1861, 1881 and 1901. This parish alone of the eight in the project maintained a steady population. The one cement factory at Whorne&#039;s Place had started in 1799. Perhaps the Earl of Darnley, as the principal landowner, placed restrictions on the creation of new housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Strood and Frindsbury Census: 1901</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/strood-and-frindsbury-census-1901</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some 15,000 names the Strood and Frindsbury 1901 censuses are too unwieldy for this project in a single table. The two parishes form one conurbation on the west bank of the Medway and are best treated together. So a series of lists has been made grouping those in similar occupations: Army and Navy (bearing in mind the ordnance and powder magazine at Upnor and Chattenden); metalworking (the principal employer being the Avellng and Porter engineering works at Strood); watermen (those employed on or by the Medway); railway (at Strood); brickmakers and those building houses locally; cement; the British Oil and Cake Mills at Strood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Aylesford and Eccles Census</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/aylesford-and-eccles-census</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aylesford is one of the largest parishes in the group and incorporates differing areas. The old village is the centre, but the Preston Hall estate covers much ground to the south. Eccles developed during the nineteenth century with houses for workers in the nearby industries of lime, cement and brick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Census returns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1801     912&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1811     875&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1821     1136&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1831     1301&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1841     1344&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1851     1487&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1861     2057&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1871     2100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1881     2719&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1891     2947&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1901     2678&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Burham Census Returns</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/burham-census-returns</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burham was transformed following the building of Thomas Cubitt&#039;s brick and cement works in 1852-5, later the Burham Brick, Lime &amp;amp; Cement Co. Ltd. There were two smaller works in the parish: the West Kent Portland Cement &amp;amp; Gault Brick Co. Ltd., who also operated the West Kent Works.Burham census returns are:1801  1441811  1581821  2361831  2871841  3801851  5181861  7731871  11721881  13531891  16671901  1687&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Wouldham Census</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/wouldham-census</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth in the population is due to the presence of the Lime and Cement Works in the parish which William Peters established in the 1850s and 1860s. This expanded in later years to become the largest factory of its kind. Census returns for Wouldham are:1801: 1651811: 1591821: 1761831: 2471841: 2841851: 3431861: 4331871: 8181881: 12681891: 13731901: 1272&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
