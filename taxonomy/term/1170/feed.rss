 <title>Ibstock Probate Material, 1640 and earlier</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/ibstock-probate-material-1640-and-earlier</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibstock is one of Leicestershire&#039;s largest villages. It is in the west Leicestershire coalfield area, and both coal mining and clay extraction for brick-making have shaped its size and character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other mining villages in this area, nonconformity was strong. The village had one of the very few British schools in the county (affiliated to the non-denominational British and Foreign Schools Society), in contrast to most Leicestershire villages, where the school was closely tied to the Anglican church. Plans of the British School show that it had the sloping floor beloved by educationalist Joseph Lancaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probate inventories reveal a diverse community lived here in the late 16th, 17th and early 18th centuries. Some people had substantial wealth, often in money and bonds (loans to others) rather than farming assets. The quantity and range of goods in Samuel Goadby&#039;s shop (1705) are similar to those found in the shops of market towns.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ibstock glebe terriers</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/ibstock-glebe-terriers</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coal mining and clay extraction have shaped the size and character of present day Ibstock. Probate inventories for this parish can now be found on VCH Explore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glebe terriers provide details of the land owned by the church (the glebe), used to support its ministry in the parish. Before enclosure, this land lay as strips scattered across the open fields of the parish. Glebe terriers can therefore provide topographical information about the parish. Some can also set out local customs, for example in respect of tithes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
