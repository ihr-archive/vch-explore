 <title>Steventon, Hampshire,  Census Returns 1851-1901</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/steventon-hampshire-census-returns-1851-1901</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steventon was a small agricultural village mainly on the chalk of the Hampshire downs. The farming was mixed with predominantly corn and sheep but in the late 19th century cattle were increasingly raised and the importance of sheep declined slightly. After 1881 there was a resident lord of the manor, before that the village was dominated by the rector and the tenant of the Manor farm. Population increased slowly during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no station in Steventon but the London to Southampton line crossed the parish and some villagers worked on the railway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Steventon Probate Material, 1521-1540</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/steventon-probate-material-1521-1540</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a suggestion of an epidemic disease in 1533 as only four wills survive for the 1530s, all of which are from July and August 1533  which indicate it may have been plague. Plague deaths usually peaked from July to October. The four who died were related. No parish records of burials exist for this period so this interpretation cannot be confirmed. See Social History.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wills of the 1520s and the early 1530s precede the Reformation and display Catholic religious practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text.

Basingstoke is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
