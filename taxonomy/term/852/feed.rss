 <title>‘Basingstoke Churches and the People’</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/%E2%80%98basingstoke-churches-and-people%E2%80%99</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title of this item is taken from the headline of reports which appeared in the 21 March and 4 April 1903 editions of the &lt;em&gt;Hants and Berks Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. In the first the findings of a census of churchgoing undertaken in Basingstoke by the newspaper were presented. While in the second the results were compared with those from a earlier census carried out in 1882, with attention being drawn to the fact that in the 21 years between them the population of Basingstoke had gone up by 43.5 percent, while the increases in attendance at places of worship in the morning and evening were only 1.9 percent and 14.5 percent respectively. The observation was also made that ‘of all the denominations in the town’, it was the Established Church that ‘had made the greatest advance.’ Nevertheless, the censuses did show that at the time they were undertaken many denominations were represented in the ecclesiastical landscape of Basingstoke, thereby contributing to the diversity and richness of the religious heritage of the town. The results of the two censuses, together with those of the 1851 national religious census, provide historians with valuable insights into the relative strength of the churches both collectively and individually during the second half of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth. It is a great pity that similar surveys were not undertaken in subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For full details of the censuses please see the asset)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Basingstoke Probate Material 1691-1700</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-probate-material-1691-1700</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this period the probate documents of 18 inhabitants of Basingstoke have been selected to reflect the range of occupations in the town, some show the move to brewing following the decline of the cloth industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 wills and 11 inventories have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office and The National Archives. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Basingstoke is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Basingstoke Probate Material 1681-1690</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-probate-material-1681-1690</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this period 23 probate documents have been selected to reflect the range of occupations in the town and show the move to brewing following the decline in the cloth industry. Three documents relate to the wealthy Acton family and two to men serving the town’s medical needs – an apothecary and a surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 wills and 10 inventories have been transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office and The National Archives. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written.

 <title>Basingstoke Census 1881</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-census-1881</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole of the 1881 census for Basingstoke parish has been transcribed by the New VCH Hampshire volunteers, based in the town. This information will be used for a detailed analysis of the population, households, age, occupations and migration etc. Because of the large number of inhabitants a complete spreadsheet is rather unwieldy so the data has been recorded on separate sheets, one for each of the 11 Districts enumerated. A link to the spreadsheet is below together with the enumerators’ descriptions of their walks around the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of people counted on 3rd April 1881 is 6,769 which can be compared with 4,262 residents recorded in 1851, also on line together with comments and analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-census-1851&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be remembered that this is just a snapshot of one night and many inhabitants may have been visitors, lodgers or even away from the town. Further work on the analysis of this data will be published in the future but it is interesting to note the inns (many of which are no longer in existence), employees in the clothing trade, iron foundry, breweries and railway but farmers and agricultural labourers are still evident presumably providing supplies to the town.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this decade a selection of 18 probate records comprising 12 wills, 12 inventories and one renunciation have been chosen from the available material because of their occupations, reflecting the woollen industry and diversification of other trades in the town.

 <title>Portals Paper Mills, 1718-1995: Papermakers to the Bank of England</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/portals-paper-mills-1718-1995-papermakers-bank-england</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portals paper mills have had a profound economic and social effect on Overton parish. In the south of England, it is most unusual to find a single dominant industrial employer over such a long period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Portal, a Huguenot refugee from France, was awarded the contract to make hard-wearing banknote paper for the Bank of England in 1724. The company grew steadily, eventually outgrowing the limited space at Laverstoke Mill, 1km beyond the boundary of Overton parish, and a new factory was built at Overton Station in 1924. Portals became the largest security paper company in the world, employing about 1,550 people in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Settlement and buildings in Overton, Hampshire</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/settlement-and-buildings-overton-hampshire</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These articles trace the history of the settlement from the earliest times to the present day, including the new town established by the bishops of Winchester in 1218, the historic hamlets along the River Test at Southington, Quidhampton and Polhampton and the settlement at Northington, deserted in the 15th century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building styles and materials in Overton Conservation Area are described along with selected listed and non-listed buildings which illustrate the character of the settlement. An account is given of the continual process of demolition, rebuilding and in-filing as well as expansion beyond the historic core of the village in the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>May Street Congregational Church, Basingstoke: 1913-1941</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/may-street-congregational-church-basingstoke-1913-1941</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1913 London Street Congregational Church in Basingstoke purchased and reopened the Nonconformist Mission Hall in May Street, which had formerly been the home of the now defunct Railway Mission. For the next 28 years, the Hall was blessed with effective leadership, both clerical and lay, and offered a spiritual home and social centre for those living within its catchment area, one of the poorer parts of Basingstoke. The Hall’s first pastor was John Gamble, who served from 1913 to 1915. Describing himself as ‘God’s ambassador’, one of his early innovations was lantern slide services which were, not surprisingly well received. Following Gamble’s departure, what became known formally as May Street Congregational Church did not have a dedicated pastor but shared one with London Street’s village chapels. All of these pastors made their mark. Noah Brewer (1916-22) was, for example, ‘a man of firm convictions and evangelistic fervour’; John Jefferson (1923-27) ‘a good organiser, musical, and a very faithful preacher of the Gospel’; William Robinson (1927-31) ‘a zealous and devoted minister’; Frederick Ewen (1932-36) a man who loved ‘people of all ages … [and had] an inexhaustible sense of humour’; and Kenneth Boxall (1937-40) ‘a man of great wisdom and experience’. For many years there was a thriving Sunday school, branch of the Band of Hope, Young People’s Guild and Mother’s Meeting. In addition to acts of worship and missions, there were public teas and fund raising events. In 1925 the Hall was renovated at a cost of between £50 and £60. Following the outbreak of the Second World War every effort was made to carry on as usual, but by 1941, with the Church being situated in a ‘danger zone’, this became increasingly difficult. Boxall had resigned in the autumn of 1940 and a few months later, first the Sunday school teachers and scholars joined with London Street, and then church members did the same. Although May Street’s demise had undoubtedly been hastened by the War, it also reflected the difficulties involved in sustaining a place of worship in a deprived part of town.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Basingstoke Volunteer Fire Brigade</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-volunteer-fire-brigade</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrangements for fire-fighting in the town before the creation of Basingstoke Volunteer Fire Brigade are unclear. An inventory of the goods inside Basingstoke church taken by the churchwardens in May 1728, listed a fire engine with 16 buckets. Also potentially of use in fire-fighting was the “cradle for mending the tower” and two ladders. This indicates that the cost of purchasing and maintaining the engine might have been met from church rates. An account of a fire in the town later that year refers to “the playing of two Engines” and the use of firehooks. It is not clear whether the second engine was owned by the town, or by a Fire Insurance Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fire brigade was established in 1838 to serve Basingstoke and the surrounding villages. It was resolved that the engine would be sent to any parish in the vicinity of Basingstoke in the event of fire if the messenger brought a written undertaking signed by a responsible inhabitant of the parish confirming they would pay £2 for each engine required and all the expenses attending the conveyance.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Basingstoke Probate Material 1641-50</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-probate-material-1641-50</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The English Civil War broke out in August 1642. Hampshire was divided between Royalists and Parliamentarians and was the setting for many battles and sieges. The bishop of Winchester stayed in his palace until October 1645 and the proving of wills continued in his courts. Bishops were abolished in 1646. After this date, if wills were proved it was at the Prerogative Court of Canterbury (PCC) so they are preserved in the National Archives. The usual rule that only wills which reflected interests in more than one diocese were proved in the PCC did not apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These documents reflect the continued importance of the cloth industry in Basingstoke with four clothiers and one weaver included. The clothiers were all wealthy and substantial business men with two of them also owning a dyehouse. Malting and brewing was also increasingly important in the town by this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other documents reveal urban occupations such as chandler, woollen draper, grocer and collar maker. It is interesting to compare the domestic contents of inventories in Basingstoke in this period with those compiled for the surrounding villages such as Mapledurwell and Newnham to see whether a wider range of goods was possessed by townspeople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of these twenty people died intestate so only the inventories survive. Links to the transcriptions are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Basingstoke is described as being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
