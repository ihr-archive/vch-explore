 <title>Herriard Census 1801-1901</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/herriard-census-1801-1901</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcriptions and analysis of all the censuses have been made by the New VCH Hampshire volunteer group based in Basingstoke.  These can be found below as well as details of residents of the Basingstoke Workhouse who were born in Herriard for each decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population records of Herriard in the 19th century are particularly valuable as census records from 1801 have been preserved in the estate archives of the Jervoise family, who are still the major landowners in 2013. The 1801 census was recorded as the ‘State of Population of the Parish of Herriard in the County of Southampton taken March 12th 1801 by virtue of an Act of Parliament which passed 41st Geo 3rd&#039;. The census was taken by John Newlyn , churchwarden, and Thomas Powell, overseer of the poor.  Returns were also taken in 1821 when 369 inhabitants were recorded (198 males, 171 females) and on May 30th 1831 when the numbers increased to a total of 425 (235 males, 190 females).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
