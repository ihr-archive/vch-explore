 <title>Frisby on the Wreake Probate Material, 1661-1700</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/frisby-wreake-probate-material-1661-1700</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frisby-on-the Wreake is a rural parish which stands along the river Wreake, eleven miles north-east of Leicester and four miles south of Melton Mowbray. There are some fine houses in the village, suggesting a prosperous agricultural past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Thomas a Becket church in the village became infamous in the late 18th century as the &#039;Gretna Green&#039; of Leicestershire. Examination of the parishes registers shows that between 1701 and 1774 there were an average of 1.7 marriages in each year, but between 1775 and 1783 (inclusive) the annual average was more than 9, with the peak year being 1787, when 15 marriages were conducted. From 1784 the numbers returned to the more usual one or two weddings each year.&lt;/p&gt;
