 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;Loddington is a very small rural settlement and civil parish in east Leicestershire with a population of less than 100.  The settlement lies in a protected hollow, and to the south of the settlement the land slopes down to the Eye Brook, which forms the southern boundary of the parish. The eastern boundary is also the county boundary with Rutland. 


John Nichols (1800) described Loddington as &#039;one of the finest lordships of old enclosure&#039; in the county. W.G. Hoskins saw the area as ‘lovely withdrawn country’, which is ‘more like Devon than Leicestershire’.


Loddington does not have a Parish Council as such but forms a Parish Meeting with Launde civil parish to the north.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
