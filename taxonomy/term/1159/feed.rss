 <title>The Retail Trade in Lutterworth</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/retail-trade-lutterworth</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutterworth&#039;s market charter was granted in 1214. A fresh charter was obtained in 1414 for both the market and an annual fair, held on the eve and day of the Ascension. A survey of 1509 shows that specialist market areas had appeared: the Neats Market for the sale of young cattle, &#039;le Fleshamills&#039; for butchers and a Woodmarket, one of the widest streets in the west of the town. By 1607 the Neats Market had been joined by a Beast Market, a &#039;Shepemarket&#039;, a &#039;Cornemarkett&#039;, an Iron Market and a Drapery.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permament shops had also emerged by the 17th century, some selling just one product, for example, hats, but also large general stores (perhaps only one at any one time), selling cloth, groceries and a small number of household items, including writing paper and arsenic.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1790 the market was said to be of &#039;no great note&#039;, and the livestock element suffered a fatal blow when the railway failed to come to the town until 1899.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small weekly market is still held in 2015 in the market square by the 1836 Town Hall. Shops line the High Street, but the main shopping area is along Church Street. Like many small market towns, most of the shops are independently owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Farming in Lutterworth</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/farming-lutterworth</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutterworth is a market town in south Leicestershire. The open fields were enclosed by a parliamentary award of 1792, but by the late 16th century there were two areas of enclosured land within the parish, Moorbarns, which was taken from the open fields in the reign of Elizabeth, and the land which had belonged to the medieval hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Schools in Lutterworth</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/schools-lutterworth</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutterworth is a small market town in south Leicestershire, close to the borders of Warwickshire and Northamptonshire. It had a number of educational charities, which supported two schools for boys and one for girls, and also provided apprenticeships for poor children. Under a scheme prepared by the Endowed Schools Commissioners in 1874, these charities were merged to create the Sherrier public elementary school (built in 1876) for boys, girls and infants. Lutterworth Grammar School, originally for 50 boarders and 30 day-pupils, also owes its beginnings to the original charities, and opened in 1881.  Lutterworth (Secondary) Modern school opened in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutterworth was one of the last parishes in Leicestershire to become part of the so-called &#039;Leicestershire Plan&#039;, which introduced comprehensive education across the county&#039;s secondary schools in stages between 1957 and 1969 through a high-school/upper-school structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Lutterworth Probate Material, 1641-1660</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/lutterworth-probate-material-1641-1660</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutterworth is a small market town in south Leicestershire, bounded on the west by the Roman Watling Street, which is also the boundary between Leicestershire and Warwickshire. Transport links and trade have therefore always been important in its history. It was a coaching town, and much of its 18th century past has been preserved today, as the town went into decline in the 19th century when people turned to rail. Today it is again a transport hub, with easy access to the M1 and M6 motorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers in Lutterworth are working towards a VCH history of their town. The inventories here form only a small proportion of the surviving probate material for this town, and more documents will be added as work progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
