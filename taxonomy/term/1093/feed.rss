 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcombe is now part of Minehead but was formerly a village in Dunster parish. The present church building dates from the early 20th century and the church community from the 1870s. However, Alcombe had a chapel in the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
