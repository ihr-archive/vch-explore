 <title>Nonconformity in Castle Donington</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/nonconformity-castle-donington</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castle Donington is in north-west Leicestershire, alongside the River Trent which forms the county boundary with Derbyshire. Many people visit the parish each year, for flights to or from East Midlands Airport, or to attend motor racing or other events at Donington Park. Few, however, venture into the village. A full parish history is being researched for publication by the VCH. This piece about Protestant nonconformity gives a flavour of life in a village where many held nonconformist beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Castle Donington Probate Material, 1661-1680</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/castle-donington-probate-material-1661-1680</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castle Donington is a small market town in north-west Leicestershire. Its character has changed completely over the last 50 years, with the coming of the M1 motorway to the east, the creation of East Midlands Airport immediately to the south, and with the expansion of motor racing activity at Donington Park, in the south-west of the parish. Little remains of the castle, from which the settlement takes its name. The centre of the village has a concentration of notable buildings, many of them listed, and has been a conservaton area since 1972 - the first in the county.&lt;/p&gt;
