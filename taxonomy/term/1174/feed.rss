 <title>Glenfield Glebe Terriers</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/glenfield-glebe-terriers</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glebe terriers set out the glebe lands owned by the church. Where the lands are extensive and are part of the open fields of the village, each individual strip may be described in relation to its furlong and to the strips of other villagers. The terrier usually also describes the size and condition of the parsonage and (especially from 1698) may conclude with details of tithe customs and other sums due to the incumbent, for example for baptisms and burials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are invaluable documents to the local historian, both for the history of the church and for the information they can provide about agriculture and the layout of the open fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenfield is a village five miles west of Leicester&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
