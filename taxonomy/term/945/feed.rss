 <title>East Side</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/east-side</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposite Nos. 1–2, former commercial use can be seen in Weavers and Tiverton Cottages. Much of the street&#039;s east side, however, is taken up by the former almshouses and by Vick&#039;s Byways Garage. Opposite the Old Vicarage are Ford Close and Emmanuel Cottage, another late 18th- or 19th-century cottage pair; each have long gardens, the former now displaying a Chinese influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>West Side</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/west-side</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This near-continuous run of cottages begins with Nos. 1–2 , where stonework shows that a first-floor central casement has been removed. The central dormer was probably shared between the two attics, with a central partition forming the window&#039;s central mullion. Beyond, Homeleigh and No. 4 display a rusticated treatment typical of the mid 20th century; No. 4 has a memorial stone to Nan Meadows (1912–88), a former District Nurse and (latterly) peace campaigner. Fortey’s Close, perhaps the most stylish house in the street, is followed by Nos. 5–8, built in the 18th century as two mirror-image cottage pairs but long since converted into two houses. The street&#039;s western side ends with Russell Cox&#039;s vicarage of 1937, an excellent example of sympathetic 20th-century building in Burford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Burford and the Arts and Crafts Movement</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/burford-and-arts-and-crafts-movement</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among its most famous proponents was William Morris (1834-96), who, with others in his circle, produced hand-crafted wallpapers, textiles, furniture and books aimed at recapturing the spirit and quality of medieval craftsmanship. The movement developed a strong architectural dimension, dedicated to reviving traditional vernacular architecture based on local materials, traditional local styles, and fine craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Burford, such ideas were shared by many of the artists, writers and intellectuals who moved into the town c.1900-30, and exerted a strong impact on the town&#039;s social tone and appearance.  Among other interests they shared an enthusiasm for English folk dancing: the folksong revivalist Cecil Sharp was a visitor to both Kelmscott and Calendars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Market Houses and the Tolsey</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/market-houses-and-tolsey</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its primary function was as a market house - the name &#039;Tolsey&#039;, found particularly in the Cotswolds and Wiltshire, suggests a place where market tolls were collected, and the building overlooked the town&#039;s main medieval market area on High Street, allowing officials in the upper chamber to oversee the proceedings. Its location allowed it to face down Sheep Street as well as High Street, though in fact the building turns its back to Sheep Street: presumably by 1525 the market area there had become less significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Chantries, Obits and Altars</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/chantries-obits-and-altars</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To medieval parishioners, heaven and hell were not abstract ideas but reality, reinforced by the wall paintings which adorned most parish churches. Wealth and prestige were no safeguard against damnation: artists frequently delighted in showing merchants, kings, bishops and even popes among the tormented souls in Hell. Good works and adherence to Christian doctrine were performed in order to avoid hell. But the deceased might spend centuries in Purgatory, waiting to be sent to heaven. So an industry developed of wealthy parishioners founding chantry chapels, or side altars and obits, where masses could be said for the souls of the deceased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Medieval Shops</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/medieval-shops</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many medieval towns, Burford&#039;s earliest shops were probably market stalls. Some may have stood in the centre of the street or under the Tolsey colonnade. Others stood in front of the house where the owner worked, such as a craftsmen or butcher. Over time these stalls became permanent structures. Fifteenth century shops are recognisable by their wide four-centered arched windows. Wooden shutters often opened upwards and downwards, the lower shutter acting as a counter when opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Reconstructing Medieval Towns</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/reconstructing-medieval-towns</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of medieval towns relies on the fact that the property boundaries which define urban house-plots (burgages) are very unlikely to change over time. Excavations in York and Southampton have shown that some plot boundaries survived unchanged for a millennium or more, carefully marked out using hedges, fences or walls. Plots were laid out based on a standard perch (16.5 ft). In Burford it is still possible to find plots which have retained their original dimensions from the late 12th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information is found in the attached documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
