 <title>Thameside</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/thameside</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henley grew up on the back of the Thames river trade with London, and from the Middle Ages the waterfront has been a vital part of the town. By the 14th century much of the riverside on both sides of the bridge was occupied by granaries (see map), many of which were owned at first by London-based corn-mongers, and later by wealthy Henley-based merchants such as John Elmes (died 1460). Most are long gone, though the long, jettied ranges at 67–73 Friday Street and 10 Thameside (partly dendro-dated to 1549) may be one survival, and the medieval Chantry House (which backs onto the river on the east) may also have originated as a trading building. Wharfs south of Friday Street and north of New Street were well established by the 16th or 17th century, and the whole of the waterfront was still used for loading huge Western barges in the 1780s, when Barrett March, owner of the Red Lion Inn, built new granaries along the stretch between Hart Street and New Street, adjoining the inn on the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the decline of the river trade in the 19th century and its replacement by recreational boating and the Regatta, the character of Henley&#039;s waterfront began to change. A new embankment had already been built along the Hart Street to New Street stretch in the 1780s, and as the Regatta grew in popularity the riverbank was transformed by new boatyards, boathouses and hotels. River Terrace, an imposing block of white-stuccoed, three-storey houses south of Friday Street, was built in 1866 in the hope of attracting wealthy residents, though most ended up as up-market lodging houses. The neighbouring Royal Hotel followed in 1869, to be rebuilt in neo-Tudor style in 1899–1900 by the Reading architect G.W. Webb. Further north, the Red Lion granaries were replaced in 1888-9 by Tom Shepherd&#039;s boat-building sheds (now shops), which had a first-floor veranda for viewing the Regatta, and which built everything from skiffs to 80-foot steam yachts. The nearby Little White Hart was rebuilt in an extravagant ‘Old English’ style a few years later, its gabled roof-line enlivened by terracotta dragons. Beyond New Street private boathouses replaced the old commercial wharfs, two of them owned in 1901 by Frank Crisp of Friar Park and Colonel Makins of Rotherfield Court. The first permanent regatta grandstand went up near Phyllis Court in 1913, completing the essentials of the modern Henley riverscape. The striking Royal Regatta headquarters were built on the opposite (Berkshire) bank in 1986.   But not all waterfront buildings were directly associated with the river. The Red Lion, whose riverside frontage extends some way along Thameside, was primarily associated with coaching, and was one of the first buildings which travellers approaching from London would see. Just south of the bridge stands the appropriately named Angel on the Bridge Hotel, which was established as an inn by the early 18th century, and which incorporates in its cellars part of an ancient stone arch left over from the demolished medieval bridge. Almost opposite stands the early 18th-century Old Rectory, one of Henley&#039;s most imposing houses, with its fine brick front and tall sash windows. For a time it was owned by the wealthy brewer James Brooks, before being acquired as a rectory house in the 1820s.   &lt;em&gt;Read the censuses for Thameside and the waterfront (see Assets opposite).

 <title>Northfield End</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/northfield-end</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;NORTHFIELD END is the name for the stretch of road which links the Fairmile (from Bix and Assendon) with the northern end of Bell Street, on the town&#039;s extreme northern edge. (See map). With Bell Street it forms part of Henley&#039;s original medieval street plan, and its origins may, in fact, pre-date the town, since the Fairmile follows the approximate line of the Roman road from Dorchester. The road from Marlow, which is also of medieval origin, intersects Northfield End just beyond Bell Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northfield End lay just outside the town boundary until the borough was extended in 1894. But from the Middle Ages there was suburban development here, with houses and other buildings (including a mill) mentioned from the 14th and 15th centuries. The name originated as &#039;Old Field&#039; (from a small open field close by), and was gradually corrupted first to Naldefeld and later to Northfield. The form &#039;Northfield End&#039; was established by the 16th century.   Up here away from the commercial heart of the town there was room for larger houses set apart from the noise, bustle and smell of the town centre. From an early date, therefore, Northfield End may have had a relatively genteel suburban character, though this was always tempered by the presence of farmers, craftsmen and tradesmen. Even in 1901 doctors, solicitors and those with private means rubbed shoulders with corn dealers, bakers, carriers, coach builders, and labourers.   This mix is reflected in the buildings, which include small 18th- and 19th-century cottages or shops as well as those with grand 18th-century facades (e.g. Nos 9 and 11, the former concealing an earlier timber-framed house). Another grand frontage is that of the former Bell Inn (just north of Bell Lane), which was established here by the late 16th century and became one of the town&#039;s busiest and most upmarket coaching inns, until its conversion into a new home for Henley Grammar School in the 19th century. Another building of note is the Friends&#039; (Quaker) meeting house, established in converted cottages at Northfield End in the early 1660s, and largely rebuilt in brick in 1894.   Read the censuses for Northfield End.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Henley&#039;s Street Plan</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/henleys-street-plan</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henley&#039;s central streets originated probably in the late 12th century, when the planned town of Henley was laid out alongside the river within a pre-existing royal estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder may have been King Henry II, who is known to have founded other towns including New Woodstock in west Oxfordshire. Such town foundations were common from the 11th to early 13th centuries, and represented hard-headed commercial ventures by wealthy lords hoping to benefit from the expanding economy and growing commercialization of the period. Henley proved a success, based partly on its role in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/Counties/Oxfordshire/Projects/HenleyOnThames/Items/Henley_and_the_Thames_River_Trade?Session/@id=L_p1wIW1s71HvGKb6iaJlP&quot;&gt;Thames river trade&lt;/a&gt;.   The early street plan was simple, comprising two main intersecting roads (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/Counties/Oxfordshire/Projects/HenleyOnThames/Items/Henley_s_Streets/assetdetails/4790?Session/@id=L_p1wIW1s71HvGKb6iaJlP&quot;&gt;see map&lt;/a&gt;). The first was a single, broad east-west street, leading eastwards across the medieval bridge, and opening up on the west into a wide wedge-shaped market place. In the Middle Ages its whole length was called High Street, but from the 16th or 17th century its east end became known as Hart Street, from the medieval White Hart Inn on its north side. Intersecting it was a north-south route from Oxford and Dorchester to Reading, known in the Middle Ages as North Street (north of the crossroads) and Brook Street (south of the crossroads, so called from the town brook or ditch near its southern end). These later became known as Bell Street (from the important Bell Inn at Northfield End), and Duke Street (a corruption of Ditch or Duck Street). Both streets may have existed in some form before the town was laid out.   Friday Street, on the medieval town&#039;s southern edge, may have originated as a small squatter settlement, though by c.1300 its north side was included in the town, and it acquired some high-quality late medieval houses. New Street (running from Bell Street to the river) was an addition to the original town plan, but seems to have been built up by 1307 when it was mentioned in a surviving property conveyance.   Until the early 19th century Henley&#039;s street plan expanded very little. But from then on there was pronounced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/Counties/Oxfordshire/Projects/HenleyOnThames/Items/Henley_s_19th_Century_Suburbs?Session/@id=L_p1wIW1s71HvGKb6iaJlP&quot;&gt;suburban growth&lt;/a&gt;, particularly to the south along Reading Road and the neighbouring St Marks Estate (e.g. St Marks Road, St Andrews Road, Vicarage Road etc). Station Road was laid out to serve the new railway station (opened 1857), with Queen Street (1879) and King&#039;s Road added later. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/Counties/Oxfordshire/Projects/HenleyOnThames/Items/Henley_s_Streets/assetdetails/4789?Session/@id=L_p1wIW1s71HvGKb6iaJlP&quot;&gt;See map&lt;/a&gt;.)   Further growth took place in the 20th century, with new building along Peppard Lane and Mount View (1930s), and after the Second World War on the Gainsborough estate and elsewhere on the town&#039;s west side. Even so, Conservation legislation has done much to preserve the town&#039;s character and save it from unbridled expansion, particularly on the north along the ancient Fair Mile.    &lt;strong&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/Counties/Oxfordshire/Projects/HenleyOnThames/Items/Henley_s_Streets/assetdetails/4791?Session/@id=L_p1wIW1s71HvGKb6iaJlP&quot;&gt;Henley&#039;s medieval origins&lt;/a&gt; and 19th-century &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.englandspastforeveryone.org.uk/Counties/Oxfordshire/Projects/HenleyOnThames/Items/Henley_s_19th_Century_Suburbs?Session/@id=L_p1wIW1s71HvGKb6iaJlP&quot;&gt;suburban development&lt;/a&gt;, or explore particular streets (including census entries):  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Station Road</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/station-road</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Station Road was laid out by the Great Western Railway c.1857, to provide access to the new railway station. Until then this was open agricultural land in Rotherfield Greys parish, and both the station and the street remained technically outside the town until 1892, and outside Henley parish until 1905 (see boundaries). The modern street runs from the waterfront through to Reading Road (see map), but as first built it was a gated private road which was closed to the public overnight. The original station building stood much closer to the street than its modern counterpart, and the large curve on the street&#039;s north side (now partly occupied by Perpetual House) accommodated the turntable, used for turning steam locomotives at the end of the line. The turntable was moved to the east of the station in 1903.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The borough council took over responsibility for Station Road in 1877, but the street was built up only gradually, as part of a more general suburban development of the area south of Friday Street and along Reading Road. Queen Street (leading to Station Road from Friday Street) was laid out in 1879 and built up piecemeal during the 1880s, while Caxton Terrace (at Station Road&#039;s west end) was put up in 1885. The Imperial Hotel was built nearer the station in 1896, its extravagant half-timbering clearly meant to catch the eyes of the thousands of visitors who poured in by train particularly during the Regatta. The flanking Imperial Parade was presumably contemporary, and the nearby Royal Hotel (built in 1869, fronting the riverside) was rebuilt in 1899-1900. A Roman Catholic church just north of the station was built in 1888-9. The street&#039;s south side, by contrast, remained largely empty until well into the 20th century, opening onto a field called Station Meadow. Iron railings along that stretch replaced post-and-wire fencing in 1907. The station itself was extended and improved in 1891 and again in 1903--4, when a new booking office was added.   Though the Henley line escaped closure in the 1960s both it and the station were downgraded. The remaining station buildings were demolished in 1975, to be replaced in 1984 by a featureless and much smaller ticket office set a little way south of Station Road. The original station site was replaced by equally featureless offices. The area&#039;s increasingly run-down feel was partly reversed in 1993-4 by the building of Perpetual House on the street&#039;s north side, between Imperial Parade and the Royal Hotel. Designed by the Broadway Malyan firm as offices for the local investment company Perpetual plc, the building was sympathetically designed to fit in with the local vernacular, combining brick and stone, and featuring pitched roofs and a massive central archway.   &lt;em&gt;Read the censuses for Station Road (see Assets opposite).&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
