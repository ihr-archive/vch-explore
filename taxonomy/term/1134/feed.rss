 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre is located in Chippenham. It holds a vast amount of material on the history of Wiltshire and Swindon. It is open to members of the public who are interested in tracing ancestors, the history of their parish or town, educational projects and other heritage based matters. The centre holds over 40,000 photographs of the county as well as newspapers dating back to the 18th century and detailed maps from 1773 to the present day. These show changes in infrastructure and population density of all Wiltshire settlements. The Centre has different departments which are accessible to all. These include archives, local studies, archaeology, conservation, Wiltshire Buildings Record and the Victoria County History.  &lt;/p&gt;
