 <title>Medway Towns Censuses: Strood High Street</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/medway-towns-censuses-strood-high-street</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strood High Street is the main artery on the old Watling Street leading from London and Gravesend to Rochester via the bridge over the Medway. It is predominantly commercial with many shops. Comparisons of the different censuses suggest that the name once extended further than in 1901, when just the section between Rochester bridge and the Old Gun pub used it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Medway Towns Censuses: Troy Town (Rochester)</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/medway-towns-censuses-troy-town-rochester</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Troy Town area of Rochester, within the parish of St Margaret&#039;s, was first built  between about 1800-1830. The ground was owned by John Cazeneuve Troy, a wealthy wine merchant of Chatham, who let it on building leases. To begin with there were four principal streets: King Street, Cazeneuve Street, John Street, and Union Street, but later expansion took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Gillingham Probate Inventories, 1715-1729</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/gillingham-probate-inventories-1715-1729</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GILLINGHAM INVENTORIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of the probate inventories for Strood, Rochester and Chatham was published in Archaeologia Cantiana, vol. 77, pp. 160-176: A. J. F. Dulley, ‘People and Homes in the Medway Towns: 1687-1783.’ For his analysis Dulley drew upon the Consistory and Archdeaconry Courts of the Diocese of Rochester, housed at the Centre for Kentish Studies. Similar material for Gillingham belongs to the Deanery of Shoreham and is kept at Lambeth Palace, so was not part of Dulley’s project. Transcriptions of these Gillingham inventories will therefore complete a survey of all the Medway Towns. We have used the microfilm copies at the Centre for Kentish Studies, but occasional blemishes prevent some lines and words from being read. The poorest people generally left neither will nor inventory, while the richest usually used the Prerogative Court of Canterbury (whose records are held at The National Archives). Even so, the Gillingham inventories show a remarkable cross-section of possessions from those apparently renting a single room to rich farmers with wealth in land, crops and animals. The dockyard workers naturally feature prominently. Probate inventories list personal possessions shortly after the death of their owner. They contain a lot of information about everyday lives and objects, and often give room by room descriptions of household goods as well as animals, crops and tools. The inventories were made by local men, often friends or acquaintances of the deceased. When these inventories were made the calendar year changed on 25 March. For dates between 1 January and 24 March inclusive, the convention of showing both years is used. Thus 9 March 1665 is expressed as 9 March 1665/6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
