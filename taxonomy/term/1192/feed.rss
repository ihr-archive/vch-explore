 <title>Stoney Stanton Probate Material, 1600-1710</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/stoney-stanton-probate-material-1600-1710</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stoney Stanton takes its name (twice) from the rock on which the village stands. There is a now a diving school at a disused quarry, now known as Stoney Cove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levi Orton&#039;s inventory is interesting, in that one of the appraisers was a woman (his mother). For someone who was presumably not yet in middle age, Levi&#039;s assets were of significant value, but may have been inherited, as his mother Isabell is described as a widow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few inventories have been transcribed for this parish so far, but more will be added as research progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Schools in Stoney Stanton</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stoney Stanton is 10 miles south-west of Leicester and 6 miles east of Hinckley. As the name suggests, the village contains quarries, and a directory of 1877 describes the parish &#039;famous for its basalt rocks, which afford an inexhaustable supply&#039;. Today, we recognise the rock as a quartz-diorite, which is crushed and used in laying roads. Earlier in the 19th century, many residents were employed in framework knitting. One of the former quarries, known as Stoney Cove, is now a major inland diving centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
