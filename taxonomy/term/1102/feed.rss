	Haughton is a Village approximately 4 miles west south west of Stafford, 8 miles from Newport in Shropshire, and about 137 miles from London. It is in the Cuttlestone West Hundred of Staffordshire and in the Diocese of Lichfield lying on the A518 road from Stafford to Newport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an early date the Parish was organised to look after most communal and financial needs. Each year the parish elected officials, which included Parish Constables, Overseers of the Poor, and Surveyors of the Highways.&lt;br /&gt;
