 <title>Old Basing Probate Material 1601 to 1620</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-probate-material-1601-1620</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probate records for 29 Old Basing residents survive for this period comprising 18 wills, 23 inventories, one court paper and two sets of accounts. Several of the documents indicate considerable wealth with land owned in neighbouring parishes and gentlemen of high status, some owning weapons. Farming is dominant as would be expected on the chalk which dominates in the south of the parish. Much of the north of the parish lies on clay soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fuller&#039;s inventory of 1602 reflected the continuing importance of the local cloth industry. Other inventories contained spinning and weaving equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John White (d.1608) was very interesting as he was a gentleman and member of the Marquis of Winchester&#039;s staff with interests across southern England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents have been transcribed by the wills group of the Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke working from copies of original probate documents supplied by The National Archives and Hampshire Record Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Old Basing (Basing) Probate Material 1581-1600</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-basing-probate-material-1581-1600</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this period 21 wills, 26 inventories and one court paper survive. Mostly, these are held in Hampshire Record Office but with one in the National Archives. They show the local mixed farming community with cattle, sheep and crops. Some of the farms were on the clay soil in the north of the parish and others on the chalk in the south. One prominent faming family were the Mulfords for six of whom probate documents survive. Associated rural trades are also recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Old Basing is described as Basing being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Basingstoke Probate Material 1661-70</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/basingstoke-probate-material-1661-70</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen wills, 15 inventories and two accounts of administration have been transcribed for this decade. The increase in numbers of innholders and maltsters is evident. The cloth industry was declining but still surviving but malting and brewing were increasingly replacing cloth as the main industry. It is not clear why some of these wills were proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury when the bishopric of Winchester and its Consistory Court had been re-established following the Civil War and Interregnum. Brian Duppa was bishop 1660-2 and George Morley 1662-84.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by Hampshire Record Office and The National Archives. Words and place names have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Boundaries, landscape and communications of Overton</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/boundaries-landscape-and-communications-overton-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article describes how the Anglo-Saxon manor of Overton included the valley of the River Test for habitation, pasture and mills as well as chalk downland for arable crops, woodland and heath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routes through the parish included the Harrow Way, a Neolithic era track, a Roman road on the northern boundary, the main east-west route, which became the preferred coach road from London to Exeter, and a north- south route connecting Winchester and Newbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach traffic declined almost immediately after the opening of the London to Southampton railway and Micheldever Station in 1840. Overton Station, on the line from London to Exeter, opened in 1854.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article traces how people travelled, on foot, by bicycle, bus and car in succeeding generations and continues with a summary of communication by post, telegraph and telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several estimates of the population of Overton prior to the first census are reviewed. In 1801, the population of the parish was 1,130 and there were 230 houses.  The population grew rapidly until 1841 when it began to decline by outward migration which coincided with loss of agricultural jobs and the closure of the silk mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1901, the population had been restored to the 1841 level with increasing industrial employment at Portals paper mills. It has risen in every decade since, with increasing numbers of people commuting to work outside the parish. The population was 4,315 in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the fall in average household size, the numbers of houses doubled between 1911 and 1951, doubled again by 1991 and stood at 1,863 in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Old Basing (Basing) Probate Material 1561-1580</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-basing-probate-material-1561-1580</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen wills and inventories survive for this period, all are in Hampshire Record Office. They reflect the local farming community and related rural trades. A number of wills were made by the Mulford family, some of whom were clearly prominent in local society, such as Leonard who died in in 1573 in possession of a number of weapons including two swords. Two testators provided for their widows to lose their bequests if they remarried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The south of the parish is on the Hampshire chalk with sheep and corn, while the north is on the clay and supports more dairy farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wills and inventories survive for Old Basing in Hampshire Record Office (HRO) and The National Archives (TNA). These are being transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke and will be published in the near future. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents. Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Old Basing is described as Basing being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-basing-probate-material-1541-60</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty four wills and 22 inventories survive for this period of people involved in the local farming community and related trades. Virtually all the surviving wills reflect the pre-Reformation Catholic society with the souls of testators left to the Lady Saint Mary and the Holy Company of Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six testators died in 1557 and seven in 1558 which may reflect a local epidemic of the sweating sickness or the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wills and inventories survive for Old Basing in Hampshire Record Office (HRO) and The National Archives (TNA). These are being transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke and will be published in the near future. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear.

 <title>Old Basing (Basing) Probate Material 1521 to 1700</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/old-basing-basing-probate-material-1521-1700</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of the parish of Old Basing lies on chalk, with the sands and gravels of the Reading beds running through the centre of the village from NW to SE, separating the chalk uplands (up to 100m OD) in the south from the low-lying London clays (c.60m OD). The river Loddon flows from the chalk just west of Basingstoke through the village towards Reading, the River Lyde, another eventual tributary of the Thames, touches the parish on the south and east. Petty’s Brook, another tributary, forms part of the boundary. The variety of soils has had an impact on the agricultural richness of the parish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parish is not heavily wooded, most of the woodland being on the clay soils, or plantations within Hackwood Park in the south. The river Loddon has determined the form of the village which grew up mainly on the south bank above the flood plain between the two best crossing points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basing parish had four manors: Basing, Byfleet, Hackwood and Lychpit. One of the earliest references to the place-name is the Battle of Basing in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 871 when Alfred (before he became king) was defeated by the Danes. In Domesday, it formed part of the holding of Hugh de Port, the family who retained lordship living in Basing for a long time. It passed to the Paulet family and William Paulet in the 16th century rose to great heights in the government and rebuilt Basing House so that it became the grandest private residence in the land, visited by all the Tudor monarchs. In the 17th century it was famous for the stalwart defence of the house for King Charles during the civil wars by the fifth Marquis John Paulet. It was finally taken by Oliver Cromwell in October 1645 and was completely destroyed by Act of Parliament. It is said that houses in the village were built using bricks from Basing House. In the 18th century, the main Hampshire seat of the family, by then Dukes of Bolton, moved across the park to Hackwood House, which is not in Basing parish. The estate remained an entity until the mid 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wills and inventories survive for Old Basing in Hampshire Record Office (HRO) and The National Archives (TNA). These are being transcribed by the Wills Group of the New Victoria County of Hampshire project based in Basingstoke and will be published in the near future. These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear. Old Basing is described as Basing being in the county of Southampton, the old name for Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
