 <title>Religious Dissent in Queniborough</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/religious-dissent-queniborough</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queniborough is a small rural parish located within the Wreake Valley of north-east Leicestershire. It is 7 miles north-east of the county town of Leicester and 9 miles south-west of the market town of Melton Mowbray. The village is linear in shape, with the historic core stretching from St Mary&#039;s church at the east end of the village along Main Street. This part of the village has been designated a Conservation Area and contains over 30 listed buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Queniborough Probate Material, 1701-1750</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/queniborough-probate-material-1701-1750</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queniborough is a linear village, half way between Leicester and Melton Mowbray. For a relatively small village it has a wealth of probate material and (very helpfully) many of the inventories are in the same clear and easy-to-read hand. As with most Leicestershire villages, Queniborough&#039;s economy was largely based on agriculture in the Stuart period, and we start to see some prosperous farmers emerge, renting enclosed land many miles from their home to graze more livestock than could be supported on the open fields of the village. There was also some cottage industry, with at least one weaver in the inventories that have been transcribed to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will find links to inventories from the period 1681-1700&lt;/p&gt;
