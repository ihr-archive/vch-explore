 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One will survives for the last 20 years of the 17th century. The will of Thomas Fellow of 1738 is included as his bequest to the poor of Cliddesden was the subject of dispute in the late19th century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text.

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two wills, one with an inventory attached, have been transcribed for this period. They include the first mention of a brewer and a number of gifts to the poor. The civil wars broke out in England and Scotland in 1642 and lasted until the execution of Charles I in 1649. The period from 1649-1660 was known as the Interregnum. Bishops were abolished so few wills were proved.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probate material that survives from this period includes the wills of two husbandmen, and the will and inventory of a gentlewoman, Jane Aubrey, a member of the Wallop family. Both husbandmen left gifts to the poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communities of neighbouring parishes, Cliddesden and Farleigh Wallop, were linked as the Wallop family were lords of both manors.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the five wills extant from this period were made by members of the Wallop family: Stephen and his brother Robert inherited the family estates from their father John Wallop (d.1486), the first of the family to make their home at Farleigh Wallop; and Oliver who was knighted for bravery in the war against the Scots, at Musselburgh in 1547, and was sheriff of Hampshire in 1558-59. The other two wills are those of farmers and show the wider area (beyond the parish) in which prosperous farmers operated. The Wallops were lords of the manor of Farleigh Wallop and the neighbouring parish of Cliddesden.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Farleigh Wallop Probate Material 1521 to 1738</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/farleigh-wallop-probate-material-1521-1738</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farleigh Wallop is a small village and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_parish&quot; title=&quot;Civil parish&quot;&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) south of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basingstoke&quot; title=&quot;Basingstoke&quot;&gt;Basingstoke&lt;/a&gt; on the slopes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farleigh_Hill&quot; title=&quot;Farleigh Hill&quot;&gt;Farleigh Hill&lt;/a&gt; containing 1,725 acres of hill country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty wills and nine inventories have been transcribed by the Hampshire Wills group and are reproduced here. They include a number of wills of members of the Wallop family, lords of the manor, where such members lived or died in Farleigh Wallop. The inventories of Sir Oliver Wallop (1566) and of Jane Aubrey (1620) show the wealth and life-style of this family who played host to Elizabeth I in 1591 and to Anne of Denmark in 1603. Other wills reflect the farming community and include prosperous yeomen and husbandmen. Bequests to the poor of the parish in the 17th and early 18th centuries are notable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transcriptions have been made from copies of original probate documents supplied by HRO and TNA.  Words have been modernized and punctuation added to make reading easier but names have been transcribed as written. Words in italics indicate omissions in the original document which have been added to make sense of the text. Words in square brackets indicate that they have been transcribed as seen but where the meaning is unclear.

 <title>Farleigh Wallop census 1851-1901</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/farleigh-wallop-census-1851-1901</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farleigh wallop was a parish with a non-resident landlord, the earl of Portsmouth. The population was small and consisted solely of those needed to fulfill the requirements of Lord Portsmouth in running his estate which was managed by a bailiff and under-steward. Housing was therefore limited to employees and the population dependent on their landlord. Farleigh House was let to tenants but the Wallop family used the church as a family mausoleum thus maintaining personal interest in the parish. The number of residents remained almost static, an average of 108 throughout this period. Farming involved sheep and arable, with cattle added by 1891.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Farleigh Congregational Chapel</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/farleigh-congregational-chapel</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chapel served the parish of Farleigh Wallop where the Congregational cause was established in 1900. Initially, services took the form of cottage meetings. In the course of time, however, ‘as members increased, the services were conducted at … [a] farm, by kind permission of Mr Cole.’ Then in 1906 a purpose built chapel was constructed. It was opened with considerable fanfare on Thursday 6th September by Miss Sarah Jane Wallis the Mayoress of Basingstoke, who had donated half of the cost. The chapel was located at Foxhall some distance from the main settlement on a site owned by the Earl of Portsmouth who ‘offered it on a 999 years’ lease at a nominal rent.’ The simple building was ‘of corrugated iron, with a patent felt roof, for which … [was] claimed the advantage of keeping … [it] cool in hot weather. At the rear end … [was] a shed for cycles etc., … [for] preachers and visitors from distant churches. The interior … [was] matchboarded, and … [it could] accommodate nearly one hundred people.’ In her remarks the Mayoress commented that it was now ‘comparatively easy … for those who live in villages as well as in towns to hear the Gospel of the grace of God.’ At a public meeting held later in the day, Alfred Capes Tarbolton, the minister of the parent church - London Street in Basingstoke, observed that although ‘it was only a small building, … it was well sometimes to compare the small with the great. He had thought of Solomon’s temple as compared with their little chapel. Although there were no glittering jewels or outward adornments, yet the spiritual life and glory of their services might exceed that of Solomon’s temple.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first few years after it was opened, services were held every Sunday evening and in the afternoon there was a Sunday school. There was also a fortnightly Mother’s Meeting. After a promising start, however, it was not long before the cause was struggling. Like many rural chapels the removal of families who had played a crucial role in its activities created difficulties and resulted in the closure of the Sunday school. Thus, by 1914 Farleigh was already being described as a ‘weak cause’. The chapel was ‘temporarily closed’ from 1918 to 1920. It reopened in 1921 and hosted well-attended harvest thanksgiving services during the first half of the 1920s. The roof was repaired and a stove installed. However, in 1927 the London Street deacons decided to abandon the work at Farleigh and the chapel was closed permanently, just over 20 years after it had been opened. It is not clear what happened to the building, but today there is little evidence that a chapel ever existed on the site which is covered with trees.&lt;/p&gt;
