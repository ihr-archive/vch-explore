 <title>West Lydford fair</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/west-lydford-fair</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many rural areas had fairs from the Middle Ages until the 19th century or later but few have left behind such a distinctive site as West Lydford&#039;s embanked Fair Place near the Fosse Way. The ground even gave its name to the street and hamlet adjoining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
