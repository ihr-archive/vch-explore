 <title>Aylesford</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/aylesford</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large village of Aylesford lies in the Medway Valley, Kent. The village grew up on the north bank of the river Medway, where a steep-sided knoll provided a strategic site for a church. The river also narrowed sufficiently at the point to allow for the construction of a stone-built bridge in the 14th century. Housing developed on the north bank of the river, its nucleus between church and bridge. Aylesford was once a distinct, seperated community, having very different traditions and peculiarities from it&#039;s neighbouring villages, despite their shared farming heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prehistoric landscape, surrounding Aylesford, was often given mythical significance through the identification of the barrows as the resting place of Catigern adn Horsa, believed to have been killed in battle between the Britons and Saxons nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two principal medieval estates in the parish. In 1240 a Carmelite priory had been established a quarter of a mile west of the church, close to the north bank of the Medway. The builings and lands of the Carmelites formed the post-Dissolution estate known as The Friars, owned from the later 16th century by the Sedley family,and in 1657 acquired by Caled Banks of Maidstone. Sir John Banks, Caleb&#039;s son, amassed great wealth as a merchant in London. Hus eldest daughter married Heneage Finch, son of the Earl of Nottingham. Finch inherited The Friars estate and was in 1714 created Earl of Aylesford. Successive earls continued to hold The Friars and lands in the northern half of the parish until 1882, but they never lived in Aylesford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aylesford grew wealthy in the late 17th century, due to it&#039;s importance as a bridging point over the river Medway. However, this growth was slow due to the control exercised over development by the two main landowning families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing in the area was rather lacking, as the high number of lodgers suggests. In 1861, 12.1 per cent of the parish population was recorded as either boarding or lodging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the mid to late 17th century, Aylesford contributed very little to charity compared to the surrounding villages in the Medway Valley area. In 1865, the Parish Officers of Aylesford &#039;disposed of&#039; £6 4s. to the poor, sick, widows and infirm, after collecting a fine of one shilling from members who arrived late to their montlty meetings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1851, Aylesford&#039;s population reached 1,487. However, over the next 50 years this number almost doubled, mostly moving into the new settlements built in Pratling Street and Forstal, as well as the new housing built beside the existing industry at Millhall. In the late 19th century, many of the parishioners of Aylesford found employment at the paper-mill and at the brick and pottery works.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Medway Towns Censuses: Strood High Street</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/medway-towns-censuses-strood-high-street</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strood High Street is the main artery on the old Watling Street leading from London and Gravesend to Rochester via the bridge over the Medway. It is predominantly commercial with many shops. Comparisons of the different censuses suggest that the name once extended further than in 1901, when just the section between Rochester bridge and the Old Gun pub used it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Medway Towns Censuses: Troy Town (Rochester)</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/medway-towns-censuses-troy-town-rochester</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Troy Town area of Rochester, within the parish of St Margaret&#039;s, was first built  between about 1800-1830. The ground was owned by John Cazeneuve Troy, a wealthy wine merchant of Chatham, who let it on building leases. To begin with there were four principal streets: King Street, Cazeneuve Street, John Street, and Union Street, but later expansion took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Gillingham Probate Inventories, 1715-1729</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/gillingham-probate-inventories-1715-1729</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;GILLINGHAM INVENTORIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of the probate inventories for Strood, Rochester and Chatham was published in Archaeologia Cantiana, vol. 77, pp. 160-176: A. J. F. Dulley, ‘People and Homes in the Medway Towns: 1687-1783.’ For his analysis Dulley drew upon the Consistory and Archdeaconry Courts of the Diocese of Rochester, housed at the Centre for Kentish Studies. Similar material for Gillingham belongs to the Deanery of Shoreham and is kept at Lambeth Palace, so was not part of Dulley’s project. Transcriptions of these Gillingham inventories will therefore complete a survey of all the Medway Towns. We have used the microfilm copies at the Centre for Kentish Studies, but occasional blemishes prevent some lines and words from being read. The poorest people generally left neither will nor inventory, while the richest usually used the Prerogative Court of Canterbury (whose records are held at The National Archives). Even so, the Gillingham inventories show a remarkable cross-section of possessions from those apparently renting a single room to rich farmers with wealth in land, crops and animals. The dockyard workers naturally feature prominently. Probate inventories list personal possessions shortly after the death of their owner. They contain a lot of information about everyday lives and objects, and often give room by room descriptions of household goods as well as animals, crops and tools. The inventories were made by local men, often friends or acquaintances of the deceased. When these inventories were made the calendar year changed on 25 March. For dates between 1 January and 24 March inclusive, the convention of showing both years is used. Thus 9 March 1665 is expressed as 9 March 1665/6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
