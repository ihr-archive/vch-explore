 <title>Schools in Oadby</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/schools-oadby</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oadby stands three miles south-east of Leicester, and was on the turnpike road to London. Once a village, its population expanded substantially over the 19th and 20th centuries and itÂ is now effectively a suburb of Leicester. Children from Oadby were among the first in the country to experience fully comprehensive education on the High School-Upper School model, with transfers between schools at ages 11 and 14, as part of the so-called &#039;Leicestershire Experiment&#039; of 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
