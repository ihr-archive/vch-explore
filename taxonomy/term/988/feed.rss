 <title>Minehead and the west Indies</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/assets/minehead-and-west-indies</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;label-inline&quot;&gt;Copyright:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;University of London&lt;p&gt;Minehead’s trade with the West Indies was established by the early 17th century and could be very lucrative. Merchants and sailors were not deterred by the distance and the length of time before cargoes and ships returned to port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the links with the West Indies were positive. Men were transported following the Monmouth rebellion, ships were seized by pirates who lurked in the islands and by the 18th century many local landowners had established plantations in the islands with slave labour.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Minehead and the West Indies</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/minehead-and-west-indies</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 17th and early 18th centuries Minehead&#039;s extensive overseas trade embraced the West Indies and the names of Barbados and Jamaica were associated with the lucrative tobacco trade as well as more mundane cargoes like cured herring and potatoes. The downside was piracy and shipwreck and some Minehead men faced death far from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Overton Markets and Fairs</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/overton-markets-and-fairs</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article traces the history of the fairs and markets from 1218 to the present day, including the commodities traded, how the markets were regulated and the revenues due to the Bishop of Winchester as lord of the manor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, the annual sheep fair was moved from the main street to a more convenient field and the local gentry formed an ‘Overton Sheep Fair Society’ with prizes for the best entries and a sumptuous dinner. Both initiatives resulted in a substantial increase in business with up to 100,000 animals changing hands. As with all the country fairs, however, the coming of the railways eventually resulted in its demise, as the sellers moved their sheep by rail to the major cities where prices were higher. The associated pleasure fair was revived in 2000. It is held every four years and attracts thousands of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Settlement and buildings in Overton, Hampshire</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/settlement-and-buildings-overton-hampshire</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These articles trace the history of the settlement from the earliest times to the present day, including the new town established by the bishops of Winchester in 1218, the historic hamlets along the River Test at Southington, Quidhampton and Polhampton and the settlement at Northington, deserted in the 15th century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building styles and materials in Overton Conservation Area are described along with selected listed and non-listed buildings which illustrate the character of the settlement. An account is given of the continual process of demolition, rebuilding and in-filing as well as expansion beyond the historic core of the village in the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
