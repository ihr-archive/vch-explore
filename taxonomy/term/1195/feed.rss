 <title>Schools in Bagworth</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bagworth is a mining village in west Leicestershire, around 8 miles north-west of the city centre. The story of its school is closely linked to the mining industry, which brought prosperity to the village, and yet (literally) undermined its structures. The Norman church (much restored) had to be demolished in 1968 and replaced by a lightweight building, which is now (in 2013) reaching the natural end of its life. The school effectively went the same way, and now almost all that remains of a building which was once at the heart of village life is the road sign: Old School Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
