 <title>Highworth pot</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/highworth-pot</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Roman Highworth ceramic pot was discovered in the village of Highworth in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its location is just 4 miles away from &quot;Ermin Street&quot; which was a main Roman road which was a vital connection between the settlements of Gloucester, Silchester and Circencester. The pot was found with other smaller Roman artefacts and was positioned in an upright position suggesting it had been placed in the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of a significant heavy weight as it takes several people to lift. The pot measures 2ft tall by 1 1/2 feet wide, with a 12 inch diameter mouth. The pot was used for storing milk this has been proven by the residue. It is going to be put on display in the Swindon Museum and Art Gallery.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
