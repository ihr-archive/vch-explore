 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barlestone is a small village about eight miles west of Leicester. Historically it was a chapelry of Market Bosworth, but gained full parish status in 1866. The story of education in Barlestone is linked to the complex history of the endowed grammar school at Market Bosworth, a very wealthy foundation, but one dogged by corruption, mismanagement, insanity and legal suits in the Court of Chancery.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
