 <title>Protestant Nonconformity in Ullesthorpe</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/protestant-nonconformity-ullesthorpe</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ullesthorpe is a village in south Leicestershire. Nonconformity arrived early, with the first meeting house established in 1723 at the home of a dissenter. Between then and 1800, five more meeting houses were established, all in the homes of dissenters. No indication is given as to their denomination, but evidence from the nineteenth century shows that Independents were present in the village at that time. There is also evidence of a Baptist presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
