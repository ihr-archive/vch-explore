 <title>Amesbury Industry</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/amesbury-industry</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 17th century Amesbury was an important centre for the manufacture of clay pipes, quality of its products became famous far beyond the local needs it provided. Earliest known example of a “fox” pipe (believed to have been made here) names of four pipe makers are recorded as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edward Fox&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Robert Smith&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gabriel Bayley&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gabriel Gauntlet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two early writers speak favourably of Gauntlet pipes – “&lt;em&gt;the best tobacco pipes in England” – &lt;/em&gt;Aubrey and “&lt;em&gt;the best for shape &amp;amp; colour” – &lt;/em&gt;Fuller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amesbury attracted the industry due to the vast local supplies. A quarry has since been found showing the rich clay in the local soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Amesbury Agriculture </title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/amesbury-agriculture</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the later 12th century the demesne of Amesbury manor included several pastures for cattle and in the early 13th century extensive several pastures for sheep. Nearly all of Amesbury’s other land including some meadow &amp;amp; pasture for cattle was evidently used in common. Until the arrival of military establishments in the 20th century, agriculture was the mainstay of the Amesbury economy &amp;amp; the principal occupation. Before 1750 the pattern of agriculture had changed little for centuries the large common fields still being known by their medieval names and still divided into acres. Enclosure was not carried out by act of parliament at Amesbury so cannot be pinned down to a single date. The whole of Amesbury was controlled by one landowner, the duke of Queensberry and he was free to enclose his land without legal sanction. It is clear that the majority of the manor was enclosed between 1742 &amp;amp; 1771.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1771 most land owned by the manor had been divided between 6 farms in order of size; Red House farm, South Ham farm, Earl’s farm, Countess Court farm, West Amesbury farm and Kent House farm. Along with the abbey mansion controlled 5105 acres of pasture, meadowland and arable land. In 1824 only 4 farms remained. Incorporation of South Ham into Red House and parts of Kent House into Countess and west Amesbury. Increased efficiency of agriculture in 19th century caused by enclosure, machinery and irrigation. The controlled flooding created early grass crops which led to more fertile soil. In more recent years competition from abroad killed off the profit to be made in farming.           &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Amesbury Church </title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/amesbury-church</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church of St Mary &amp;amp; St Melor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church of the abbey dissolved in 1177; it had a central tower, north transept (with east chapel), south transept, and nave (with south aisle). Nave is of earlier 12th century while the remainder was built in the early 13th century. In the late 15th century much of the church was reroofed and a new east/west window was inserted. In 1852/3 the church was restored to designs by William Butterfield, he intended to remove all features later than 1400. The east window was replaced by one in a 13th century style. In the south transept the early 18th century windows were replaced by lancets similar to 13th century ones.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Records have been kept from the church in baptisms from 1624-40 and then from 1660 onwards, burials from 1610-36 and then from 1660 onwards and marriages 1610 – 39 and then from 1661 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Amesbury Markets and Fairs</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/amesbury-markets-and-fairs</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday market was granted in 1219 &amp;amp; 1252 to the lord of Amesbury manor, Saturday market in 1317 to Amesbury priory, Wednesday market in 1614 to the lord of the Ealdon &amp;amp; Priory manors although unlikely that Amesbury ever had more than one weekly market; evidently a general market for food &amp;amp; agricultural produce. In 1635 weekly market held on Fridays, market house stood at the west end of the market place. 1759 market house was repaired &amp;amp; taken down in 1809 – it was not revived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3 day fair at the fest of St Melor, (patron saint of church) granted in 1252 to the lord Amesbury manor, similar festival but different days were granted in 1317 to Amesbury priory. St Melor’s day is 1st October but the fair was probably held on and about the date of 6th may. 2 new fairs to be held on 11th June &amp;amp; 23rd December were granted to Lord Hertford in 1614. Also May fair, long fair and short fair continued into the 19th century. After 1752 May fair held on the 17th long fair on 22nd/23rd June and short fair held on 17th December, from 1760 later on the first Wednesday after the 12th December. In 1830 fairs were for trade in cattle &amp;amp; horses, in 1842 they were poorly attended and by 1888 had been discontinued.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Amesbury Airfield</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/amesbury-airfield</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stonehenge airfield landing ground between the Shrewton &amp;amp; Exeter roads west of Stonehenge was opened in 1917 for training bomber pilots. Hangers and other buildings were erected north &amp;amp; south of the Exeter road. The airfield was closed in 1920, some of the buildings were used for farming and all had been demolished by the 1930’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackcross down south east of the town Boscombe Down (initially red house farm) airfield was opened in 1917 for training pilots. Buildings were erected by 1918 extended in 1919 but the airfield was closed in 1920. Reopened in 1930 and was used mostly by bomber squadrons until 1939 when the aeroplane &amp;amp; armament experimental moved there. The evaluation establishment was still at Boscombe down in 1992, main work was to test aeroplanes &amp;amp; weapons. The airfield was greatly expanded after WWII new buildings were erected in the 1950’s. By 1937 9 houses in Allington way and had been erected for commissioned officers, 4 in main road for warrant officers and 33 in lamber road and main road for airmen. After WWII several housing estates were built on the west side of the airfield.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
