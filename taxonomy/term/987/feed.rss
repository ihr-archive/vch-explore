 <title>Overton Markets and Fairs</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/overton-markets-and-fairs</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article traces the history of the fairs and markets from 1218 to the present day, including the commodities traded, how the markets were regulated and the revenues due to the Bishop of Winchester as lord of the manor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, the annual sheep fair was moved from the main street to a more convenient field and the local gentry formed an ‘Overton Sheep Fair Society’ with prizes for the best entries and a sumptuous dinner. Both initiatives resulted in a substantial increase in business with up to 100,000 animals changing hands. As with all the country fairs, however, the coming of the railways eventually resulted in its demise, as the sellers moved their sheep by rail to the major cities where prices were higher. The associated pleasure fair was revived in 2000. It is held every four years and attracts thousands of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;label-inline&quot;&gt;Copyright:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;University of London&lt;p&gt;The area covered by the present Longrun Meadow public open space did not form part of Longrun farm until after the mid 19th century but was shared between several holdings. The name first appears in the late 18th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the 1820s there were two homesteads in the area, the second being a mill house with a mill.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longrun with its former farmstead is well known to dog walkers, runners, young people and others but the millpond is hidden and nearly dry and all trace of the mill has disappeared. The former medieval fields and meadows now form part of a large public open space between Taunton and Bishops Hull village in the floodplain of the river Tone known for its willow cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>The Retail Trade in Lutterworth</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/retail-trade-lutterworth</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutterworth&#039;s market charter was granted in 1214. A fresh charter was obtained in 1414 for both the market and an annual fair, held on the eve and day of the Ascension. A survey of 1509 shows that specialist market areas had appeared: the Neats Market for the sale of young cattle, &#039;le Fleshamills&#039; for butchers and a Woodmarket, one of the widest streets in the west of the town. By 1607 the Neats Market had been joined by a Beast Market, a &#039;Shepemarket&#039;, a &#039;Cornemarkett&#039;, an Iron Market and a Drapery.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permament shops had also emerged by the 17th century, some selling just one product, for example, hats, but also large general stores (perhaps only one at any one time), selling cloth, groceries and a small number of household items, including writing paper and arsenic.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1790 the market was said to be of &#039;no great note&#039;, and the livestock element suffered a fatal blow when the railway failed to come to the town until 1899.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small weekly market is still held in 2015 in the market square by the 1836 Town Hall. Shops line the High Street, but the main shopping area is along Church Street. Like many small market towns, most of the shops are independently owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
