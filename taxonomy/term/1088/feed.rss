 <title>Local Government since 1834</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/local-government-1834</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1834 and 1894 local government at parish level was gradually reformed.Â The changes were piecemeal and conservative in approach, so that the traditional units such as counties, boroughs, and parishes survived, even if their powers and duties were altered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Railways in the North Derbyshire Coalfield</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/railways-north-derbyshire-coalfield</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest scheme for a modern, locomotive operated railway in the Derbyshire coalfield, proposed in 1832, was for a line running down the Erewash valley in the south-east of the county to compete with the canals linking the coalfield with Nottingham, Derby and the Trent. This was not built for some years but The major wave of railway promotion in the mid-1830s included a line which ran north from Derby through the Derwent and Amber valleys before tunnelling beneath the watershed to enter the Rother valley south of Chesterfield, and from there continue to Rotherham and Leeds. As soon as the North Midland Railway opened in 1840, branches were built to nearby pits and the modern history of mining in Clay Cross and neighbouring villages began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Roads and tracks - Old Peverel Road</title>
 <link>https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/roads-and-tracks-old-peverel-road</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;item-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generations of antiquaries have sought to identify stretches of modern road or footpath as prehistoric, Roman or medieval, or they try to link references in medieval deeds to routes on the ground. In fact, there is generally little evidence for the age of roads existing today, most of which have probably been in use since the area through which they pass was first settled, long before they are mentioned in documents or shown on maps. In some areas there are established traditions of roads built for particular purposes in the Middle Ages which have since gone out of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
