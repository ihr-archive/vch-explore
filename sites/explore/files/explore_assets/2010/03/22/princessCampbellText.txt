We worked 48 hours a week. Some days the duty commenced
at 8 am and finished at 8 pm. Most of the heavy and unpleasant
work was allocated to the Black workers. The White students
would be sitting drinking tea while we would be asked to go and
clean out the bed pans and vomit... We were made to clean up
their trolleys as well as cleaning ours. At times we were demoralised
and we were not valued and your self esteem was low.
