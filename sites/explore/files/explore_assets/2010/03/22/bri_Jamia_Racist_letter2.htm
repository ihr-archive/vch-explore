<h4>Racist Letter Sent to  Jamia Mosque in Bristol</h4>
<p>A racist letter has been sent to a mosque in Bristol bearing a swastika, the symbol 'C18' and the words "White Power". The letter was delivered to the Jamia Mosque in Green St, and has been condemned by the Bristol Racial Equality Council as deeply offensive. Their Director, Peter Courtier, said: "It's very important that people who receive letters or leaflets like this should report them to the police." An investigation has been launched, but the police are so far treating it as a one-off incident. PC Steve Fraser, from Avon and Somerset's community liason department, told Muslims to contact the police if any more letters are received. He said, in a letter to Islamic organisations: "I appreciate that your first response may well be to destroy the offensive letter. However we will need the letter and envelope if possible, in order to increase the likelihood of tracking down the author and successfully prosecuting him or her" (Bristol Evening Post, 02.02.99).</p>
