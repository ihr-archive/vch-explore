<div>&lsquo;Upon the negroes refusing to take sustenance, I have seen coals of fire, glowing hot, put on a shovel, and placed so near their lips as to scorch and burn them. And this has been accompanied with threats of forcing them to swallow the coals, if, they any longer persisted in refusing to eat. These have generally had the desired effect. I have also been credibly informed that a certain captain in the slave trade, poured melted lead on such of the negroes as obstinately refused their food.</div>

<div>Exercise being deemed necessary for the preservation of their health, [the slaves]&hellip;are sometimes obliged to dance when the weather will permit their coming on deck. If they go about it reluctantly or do not move with agility, they are flogged by a person standing by them all the time with a cat-o-nine-tails in his hand for that purpose. Their musick upon these occasions consists of a drum, sometimes only one head, and when that is worn out, they do not scruple to make use of the bottom of one of the [food] tubs&hellip;The poor wretches are frequently compelled to sing also; but they do so, their songs are generally, as may naturally be expected, melancholy lamentations of their exile, from their native country.&rsquo;</div>
