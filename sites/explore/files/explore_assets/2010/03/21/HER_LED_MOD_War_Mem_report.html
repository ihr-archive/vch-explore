About one hundred ex-Servicemen mar-
shalled by Captain R.B.Gurney took part
and at their head marched three represen-<br/>
tatives of the sister services in uniform.
They were Company Quartermast-Ser 
geant F.Shinn, 1st Herefordshire Regiment, 
Corporal S.Smith R.A.F. and Stoker W. 
Neale as representing the Army, Air Force, 
and Navy respectively. A beautiful wreath 
was carried &nbsp;being the ex-Servicemen's tri- 
bute to their dead comrades, The ceremony 
commenced&nbsp; with the singing of the hymn 
"O God our help in ages past", following 
which the Rector of Ledbury (the Rev. F. 
W. Carnegy) offered prayer, during which 
a solemn silence prevailed.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The memorial, which was covered by a 
large Union Jack, was then unveiled by 
General Sir Elliott Wood K.C.E.<br/><br/>
[After the dedication by the Rev. Canon Bannister]<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast congregation sang Mr. J. S. Ark- 
wright's hymn-poem, "The Supreme Sacri-
fice", set to music by the Rev. Dr. Charles 
Harris,&nbsp; D.D.,&nbsp; Rector of Colwall.&nbsp; The 
beauty and sincerity of its language and 
sentiment, have endeared this hymn to 
countless congregations.
